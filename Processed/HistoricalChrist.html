<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This little volume was written in the spring of the
year 1913, and is intended as a plea for moderation and good sense in
dealing with the writings of early Christianity; just as my earlier
volumes entitled <i>Myth, Magic, and Morals</i> and <i>A History of New
Testament Criticism</i> were pleas for the free use, in regard to the
origins of that religion, of those methods of historical research to
which we have learned to subject all records of the past. It provides a
middle way between traditionalism on the one hand and absurdity on the
other, and as doing so will certainly be resented by the partisans of
each form of excess.</p>
<p>The comparative method achieved its first great triumph in the field
of Indo-European philology; its second in that of mythology and
folk-lore. It is desirable to allow to it its full rights in the matter
of Christian origins. But we must be doubly careful in this new and
almost unworked region to use it with the same scrupulous care for
evidence, with the same absence of prejudice and economy of hypothesis,
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e289" href="#xd25e289" name=

The untrained explorers whom I here criticize discover on almost every
page connections in their subject-matter where there are and can be
none, and as regularly miss connections where they exist. Parallelisms
and analogies of rite, conduct, and belief between religious systems
and cults are often due to other causes than actual contact,
inter-communication, and borrowing. They may be no more than sporadic
and independent manifestations of a common humanity. It is not enough,
therefore, for one agent or institution or belief merely to remind us
of another. Before we assert literary or traditional connection between
similar elements in story and myth, we must satisfy ourselves that such
communication was possible. The tale of Sancho Panza and his visions of
a happy isle, over which he shall hold sway when his romantic lord and
master, Don Quixote, has overcome with his good sword the world and all
its evil, reminds us of the na&iuml;f demand of the sons of Zebedee

exactly that of a Persian great king with his magnates on their several
&ldquo;cushions&rdquo; of state around him. There is, again, a close
analogy psychologically between Dante&rsquo;s devout adoration of
Beatrice in heaven and Paul&rsquo;s of the risen Jesus. These two
parallels are closer than most that Mr. Robertson discovers between
Christian story and Pagan myth, yet no one in his senses would ever
suggest that Cervantes drew his inspiration from the Gospels or Dante
from the Pauline Epistles. In criticizing the Gospels it is all the
more necessary to proceed cautiously, because the obscurantists are
incessantly on the watch for solecisms&mdash;or &ldquo;howlers,&rdquo;
as a schoolboy would call them; and only too anxious to point to them
as of the essence of all free criticism of Christian literature and
history.</p>

who has been so good as to peruse them, has made a few suggestions

<h2 class="main">HISTORICAL METHOD</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">Orthodox obscurantism the
parent of Sciolism</span> In <i>Myth, Magic, and Morals</i> (Chapter
IX) I have remarked that the Church, by refusing to apply in the field
of so-called sacred history the canons by which in other fields truth
is discerned from falsehood, by beatifying credulous ignorance and
anathematizing scholarship and common sense, has surrounded the figure
of Jesus with such a nimbus of improbability that it seems not absurd
to some critics of to-day to deny that he ever lived. The circumstance
that both in England and in Germany the books of certain of these
critics&mdash;in particular, Dr. Arthur Drews, Professor W. Benjamin
Smith, and Mr. J. M. Robertson&mdash;are widely read, and welcomed by
many as works of learning and authority, requires that I should
criticize them rather more in detail than I deemed it necessary to do
in that publication.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">B. Croce on nature of History</span>
Benedetto Croce well remarks in his <i lang="la">Logica</i> (p. 195)
that history in no way differs from the physical sciences, insofar as
it cannot be constructed by pure reasoning, but rests upon sight or
vision of the fact that has happened, the fact so perceived being the
only source of history. In a methodical historical treatise the sources
are usually divided into monuments and narratives; by the former being
understood whatever is left to us as a trace of the accomplished
fact&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, a contract, a letter, or a triumphal arch;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>while narratives consist of such accounts of it as
have been transmitted to us by those who were more or less
eye-witnesses thereof, or by those who have repeated the notices or
traditions furnished by eye-witnesses.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Relative paucity of evangelic
tradition</span> Now it may be granted that we have not in the New
Testament the same full and direct information about Jesus as we can
derive from ancient Latin literature about Julius C&aelig;sar or
Cicero. We have no <i>monuments</i> of him, such as are the
commentaries of the one or the letters and speeches of the other. It is
barely credible that a single one of the New Testament writers, except
perhaps St. Paul, ever set eyes on him or heard his voice. It is more
than doubtful whether a single one of his utterances, as recorded in
the Gospels, retains either its original form or the idiom in which it
was clothed. A mass of teaching, a number of aphorisms and precepts,
are attributed to him; but we know little of how they were transmitted
to those who repeat them to us, and it is unlikely that we possess any
one of them as it left his lips.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">and presence of miracles in it,</span> And
that is not all. In the four Gospels all sorts of incredible stories
are told about him, such as that he was born of a virgin mother,
unassisted by a human father; that he walked on the surface of the
water; that he could foresee the future; that he stilled a storm by
upbraiding it; that he raised the dead; that he himself rose in the
flesh from the dead and left his tomb empty; that his apostles beheld
him so risen; and that finally he disappeared behind a cloud up into
the heavens.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">explains and excuses the extreme negative
school</span> It is natural, therefore&mdash;and there is much excuse
for him&mdash;that an uneducated man or a child, bidden <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>unceremoniously in the name of religion to accept
these tales, should revolt, and hastily make up his mind that the
figure of Jesus is through and through fictitious, and that he never
lived at all. One thing only is certain&mdash;namely, that insofar as
the orthodox blindly accept these tales&mdash;nay, maintain with St.
Athanasius that the man Jesus was God incarnate, a pre-existent
&aelig;on, Word of God, Creator of all things, masked in human flesh,
but retaining, so far as he chose, all his exalted prerogatives and
cosmic attributes in this disguise&mdash;they put themselves out of
court, and deprive themselves of any faculty of reply to the extreme
negative school of critics. The latter may be very absurd, and may
betray an excess of credulity in the solutions they offer of the
problem of Christian origins; but they can hardly go further along the
path of absurdity and credulity than the adherents of the creeds. If
their arguments are to be met, if any satisfactory proof is to be
advanced of the historicity of Jesus, it must come, not from those who,
as Mommsen remarked, &ldquo;reason in chains,&rdquo; but from free
thinkers.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Yet Jesus is better attested than most
ancients</span> Those, however, who have much acquaintance with
antiquity must perceive at the outset that, if the thesis that Jesus
never existed is to be admitted, then quite a number of other
celebrities, less well evidenced than he, must disappear from the page
of history, and be ranged with Jesus in the realm of myth.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Age of the earliest Christian
literature</span> Many characteristically Christian documents, such as
the Epistle of Barnabas, the Shepherd of Hermas, and the Teaching of
the Apostles, are admitted by Drews to have been written before
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 100.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e436src"
href="#xd25e436" name="xd25e436src">1</a> Not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>only the
canonical Gospels, he tells us,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e444src"
href="#xd25e444" name="xd25e444src">2</a> were still current in the
first half of the second century, but several never accepted by the
Church&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, spurious gospels ascribed to Matthew, Thomas,
Bartholomew, Peter, the Twelve Apostles. These have not reached us,
though we have recovered a large fragment of the so-called Peter
Gospel, and find that it at least pre-supposes canonical Mark. The
phrase, &ldquo;Still current in the first half of the second
century,&rdquo; indicates that, in Dr. Drews&rsquo;s opinion, these
derivative gospels were at least as old as year 100; in that case our
canonical Gospels would fall well within the first. I will not press
this point; but, anyhow, we note the admission that within about
seventy years of the supposed date of Jesus&rsquo;s death Christians
were reading that mass of written tradition about him which we call the
Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. They were also reading a mass
of less accredited biographies&mdash;less trustworthy, no doubt, but,
nevertheless, the work of authors who entertained no doubt that Jesus
had really lived, and who wished to embellish his story.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">If Jesus never lived, neither did
Solon,</span> If, then, armed with such early records, we are yet so
exacting of evidence as to deny that Jesus, their central figure, ever
lived, what shall we say of other ancient worthies&mdash;of Solon, for
example, the ancient Athenian legislator? For his life our chief
sources, as Grote remarks (<i>History of Greece</i>, Pt. II, ch. 11),
are Plutarch and Diogenes, writers who lived seven and eight hundred
years after him. Moreover, the stories of Plutarch about him are, as
Grote says, &ldquo;contradictory as well as apocryphal.&rdquo; It is
true <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>that Herodotus repeats to us the story of
Solon&rsquo;s travels, and of the conversations he held with
Cr&oelig;sus, King of Lydia; but these conversations are obviously mere
romance. Herodotus, too, lived not seventy, but nearly one hundred and
fifty years later than Solon, so that contemporary evidence of him we
have none. Plutarch preserves, no doubt, various laws and metrical
aphorisms which were in his day attributed to Solon, just as the
Christians attributed an extensive body of teaching to Jesus. If we
deny all authenticity to Jesus&rsquo;s teaching, what of Solon&rsquo;s
traditional lore? Obviously Jesus has a far larger chance to have
really existed than Solon.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">or Epimenides,</span> And the same is true
of Epimenides of Crete, who was said to be the son of the nymph Balte;
to have been mysteriously fed by the nymphs, since he was never seen to
eat, and so forth. He was known as the Purifier, and in that
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> healed the Athenians of plagues physical and
spiritual. A poet and prophet he lived, according to some, for one
hundred and fifty-four years; according to his own countrymen, for
three hundred. If he lived to the latter age, then Plato, who is the
first to mention him in his <i>Laws</i>, was his contemporary, not
otherwise.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">or Pythagoras,</span> Pythagoras, again,
can obviously never have lived at all, if we adopt the purist canons of
Drews. For he was reputed, as Grote (Pt. II, ch. 37) reminds us, to
have been inspired by the gods to reveal to men a new way of life, and
found an order or brotherhood. He is barely mentioned by any writer
before Plato, who flourished one hundred and fifty years later than he.
In the matter of miracles, prophecy, pre-existence, mystic observances,
and asceticism, Pythagoras equalled, if he did not excel, Jesus.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">or Apollonius of Tyana</span> Apollonius of
Tyana is another example. We have practically no record of him till one
hundred and twenty years after his death, when the Sophist Philostratus
took in hand to write his life, by his own account, with the aid of
memorials left by Damis, a disciple of the sage. Apollonius, like Jesus
and Pythagoras, was an incarnation of an earlier being; he, too, worked
miracles, and appeared after death to an incredulous follower, and
ascended into heaven bodily. The stories of his miracles of healing, of
his expulsions of demons, and raising of the dead, read exactly like
chapters out of the Gospels. He, like Jesus and Pythagoras, had a god
Proteus for his father, and was born of a virgin. His birth was marked
in the heavens by meteoric portents. His history bristles with tales
closely akin to those which were soon told of Jesus; yet all sound
scholars are agreed that his biographer did not imitate the Gospels,
but wrote independently of them. If, then, Jesus never lived, much less
can Apollonius have done so. Except for a passing reference in Lucian,
Philostratus is our earliest authority for his reality; the life
written of him by Moeragenes is lost, and we do not know when it was
written. On the whole, the historicity of Jesus is much better attested
and documented than that of Apollonius, whose story is equally full of
miracles with Christ&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Miracles do not wholly invalidate a
document</span> The above examples suffice. But, with the aid of a good
dictionary of antiquity, hundreds of others could be adduced of
individuals for whose reality we have not a tithe of the evidence which
we have for that of Jesus; yet no one in his senses disputes their ever
having lived. We take it for certain that hundreds&mdash;nay,
thousands&mdash;of people who figure on the pages <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>of ancient
and medieval history were real, and that, roughly speaking, they
performed the actions attributed to them&mdash;this although the
earliest notices of them are only met with in Plutarch, or Suidas, or
William of Tyre, or other writers who wrote one hundred, two hundred,
perhaps six hundred years after them. Nor are we deterred from
believing that they really existed by the fact that, along with some
things credible, other things wholly incredible are related of them.
Throughout ancient history we must learn to pick and choose. The
thesis, therefore, that Jesus never lived, but was from first to last a
myth, presents itself at the outset as a paradox. Still, as it is
seriously advanced, it must be seriously considered and that I now
proceed to do.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Proof of the unhistoricity of Jesus, how
attainable</span> It can obviously not pass muster, unless its authors
furnish us with a satisfactory explanation of every single notice,
direct or indirect, simple or constructive, which ancient writers have
transmitted to us. Each notice must be separately examined, and if an
evidential document be composite, every part of it. Each statement in
its <i lang="la">prim&acirc; facie</i> sense must be shown to be
irreconcilable with what we know of the age and circumstances to which
it pretends to relate. And in every case the new interpretation must be
more cogent and more probable than the old one. Jesus, the real man,
must be driven line by line, verse by verse, out of the whole of the
New Testament, and after that out of other early sources which directly
or by implication attest his historicity. There is no other way of
proving so sweeping a negative as that of the three authors I have
named.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">How to approach ancient documents</span>
For every statement of fact in an ancient author is a problem, and has
to be accounted for. If it accords <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8"
href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>with the context, and the entire
body of statement agrees with the best scheme we can form in our
mind&rsquo;s eye of the epoch, we accept it, just as we would the
statement of a witness standing before us in a law court. If, on the
other hand, the statement does not agree with our scheme, we ask why
the author made it. If he obviously believed it, then how did his error
arise? If he should seem to have made it without himself believing it,
then we ask, Why did he wish to deceive his reader? Sometimes the only
solution we can give of the matter is, that our author himself never
penned the statement, but that someone covertly inserted it in his
text, so that it might appear to have contained it. In such cases we
must explain why and in whose interest the text was interpolated. In
all history, of course, we never get a direct observation, or
intuition, or hearing of what took place, for the photographic camera
and phonograph did not exist in antiquity. We must rest content with
the convictions and feelings of authors, as they put them down in
books. To one circumstance, however, amid so much dubiety, we shall
attach supreme importance; and that is to an affirmation of the same
fact by two or more independent witnesses. One man may well be in
error, and report to us what never occurred; but it is in the last
degree improbable that two or more <span class="marginnote">Value of
several independent witnesses in case of Jesus</span>independent
witnesses will join forces in testifying to what never was. Let us,
then, apply this principle to the problem before us. Jesus, our authors
affirm, was not a real man, but an astral myth. Now we can conceive of
one ancient writer mistaking such a myth for a real man; but what if
another and another witness, what if half a dozen or more come along,
and, meeting us quite <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9"
name="pb9">9</a>]</span>apart from one another and by different routes,
often by pure accident, conspire in error. If we found ourselves in
such case, would we not think we were bewitched, and take to our
heels?</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The oldest sources about Jesus</span> Well,
I do not intend to take to my heels. I mean to stand up to the chimeras
of Messrs. Drews, Robertson, and Benjamin Smith. And the best courage
is to take one by one the ancient sources which bear witness to the man
Jesus, examine and compare them, and weigh their evidence. If they are
independent, if they agree, not too much&mdash;that would excite a
legitimate suspicion&mdash;but only more or less and in a general way,
then, I believe, any rational inquirer would allow them weight, even if
none were strictly contemporaries of his and eye-witnesses of his life.
In the Gospel of Mark we have the earliest narrative document of the
New Testament. This is evident from the circumstance that the three
other evangelists used it in the composition of their Gospels. Drews,
indeed, admits it to be one of the &ldquo;safest&rdquo; results of
modern discussion of the life of Jesus that this Gospel is the oldest
of the surviving four. He is aware, of course, that this conclusion has
been questioned; but no one will doubt it who has confronted
<span class="marginnote">The Gospel of Mark used in Matthew and
Luke</span>Mark in parallel columns with Luke and Matthew, and noted
how these other evangelists not only derive from it the order of the
events of the life of Jesus, but copy it out verse after verse, each
with occasional modifications of his own. Drews, however, while aware
of this phenomenon, has yet not grasped the fact that it and nothing
else has moved scholars to regard Mark as the most ancient of the three
Synoptics; quite erroneously, as if he had never read any work of
modern textual <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>criticism, he imagines that they are led to their
conclusion, firstly by the superior freshness and vividness of Mark, by
a picturesqueness which argues him to have been an eye-witness; and,
secondly, by the evidence of Papias, who, it is said, declared Mark to
have been the interpreter of the Apostle Peter. In point of fact, the
modern critical theologians, for whom Drews has so much contempt,
attach no decisive weight in this connection either to the tradition
preserved by Papias or to the graphic qualities of Mark&rsquo;s
narratives. They rest their case mainly on the internal evidence of the
texts before them.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Contents of Mark</span> What, then, do we
find in Mark&rsquo;s narrative?</p>
<p>Inasmuch as my readers can buy the book for a penny and study it for
themselves, I may content myself with a very brief
<i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of its contents.</p>
<p>It begins with an account of one John who preached round about
Jud&aelig;a, but especially on the Jordan, that the Jews must repent of
their sins in order to their remission; in token whereof he directed
them to take a ritual bath in the sacred waters of the Jordan, just as
a modern Hindoo washes away his sins by means of a ritual bath in the
River Jumna. An old document generally called Q. (<span lang=
"de">Quelle</span>), because Luke and Matthew used it in common to
supplement Mark&rsquo;s rather meagre story, adds the reason why the
Jews were to repent; and it was this, that the Kingdom of Heaven was at
hand. <span class="marginnote">Drews&rsquo;s account of
Messianism</span>Drews, in his first chapter of <i>The Christ Myth</i>,
traces out the idea of this Kingdom of God, which he finds so prominent
in the Jewish Apocalyptics of the last century before and the first
century after Christ, and attributes it to Persian and Mithraic
influence. Mithras, he says, was to descend upon the earth, and in a
last fierce struggle overwhelm <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11"
href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>Angromainyu or Ahriman and his
hosts, and cast them down into the nether world. He would then raise
the dead in bodily shape, and after a general judgment of the whole
world, in which the wicked should be condemned to the punishments of
hell and the good raised to heavenly glory, establish the
&ldquo;millennial kingdom.&rdquo; These ideas, he continues, penetrated
Jewish thought, and brought about a complete transformation of the
former belief in a messiah, a Hebrew term meaning the anointed&mdash;in
Greek <i>Christos</i>. For, to begin with, the Christ was merely the
Jewish king who represented Jahwe before the people, and the people
before Jahwe. He was &ldquo;Son of Jahwe,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Son of
God&rdquo; <i>par excellence</i>; later on the name came to symbolize
the ideal king to come&mdash;this when the Israelites lost their
independence, and were humiliated by falling under a foreign yoke. This
ideal longed-for king was to win Jahwe&rsquo;s favour; and by his
heroic deeds, transcending those of Moses and Joshua of old, to
re-establish the glory of Israel, renovate the face of the earth, and
even make Israel Lord over all nations. But so far the Messiah was only
a human being, a new David or descendant of David, a theocratic king, a
divinely favoured prince of peace, a just ruler over the people he
liberated; and in this sense Cyrus, who delivered the Jews from the
Babylonian captivity, the rescuer and overlord of Israel, had been
acclaimed Messiah.</p>
<p>At last and gradually&mdash;still under Persian influence, according
to Drews&mdash;this figure assumed divine attributes, yet without
forfeiting human ones. Secret and supernatural as was his nature, so
should the birth of the Messiah be; though a divine child, he was to be
born in lowly state. Nay, the personality of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>Messiah
eventually mingled with that of Jahwe himself, whose son he was. Such,
according to Drews, were the alternations of the Messiah between a
human and a divine nature in Jewish apocalypses of the period
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> 100 to <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 100.
They obviously do not preclude the possibility of the Jews in that
epoch acclaiming a man as their Messiah&mdash;indeed, there is no
reason why they should not have attached the dignity to several; and
from sources which Drews does not dispute we learn that they actually
did so.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">John and Jesus began as messengers of the
divine kingdom on earth</span> Let us return to Mark&rsquo;s narrative.
Among the Jews who came to John to confess and repent of their sins,
and wash them away in the Jordan, was one named Jesus, from Nazareth of
Galilee; and he, as soon as John was imprisoned and murdered by Herod,
caught up the lamp, if I may use a metaphor, which had fallen from the
hands of the stricken saint, and hurried on with it to the same goal.
We read that he went to Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, and
saying: &ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at
hand; repent ye, and believe in the gospel or good tidings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of Mark is a narrative of what happened to Jesus on this
self-appointed errand. We learn that he soon made many recruits, from
among whom he chose a dozen as his particular missionaries or apostles.
These, after no long time, he despatched on peculiar beats of their
own. <span class="marginnote">Jesus&rsquo;s anticipations of its speedy
advent</span>He was certain that the kingdom was not to be long
delayed, and on occasions assured his audience that it would come in
their time. When he was sending out his missionary disciples, he even
expressed to them his doubts as to whether it would not come even
before they had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>had time to go round the cities of Israel.
<span class="marginnote">He confined the promises to Jews</span>It was
not, however, this consideration, but the instinct of exclusiveness,
which he shared with most of his race, that led him to warn them
against carrying the good tidings of the impending salvation of Israel
to Samaritans or Gentiles; the promises were not for schismatics and
heathens, but only for the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Some of
these details are derived not from Mark, but from the document out of
which, as I remarked above, the first and second evangelists
supplemented Mark.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Was rejected by his own kindred</span> Like
Luther, Loyola, Dunstan, St. Anthony, and many other famous saints and
sinners, Jesus, on the threshold of his career, encountered Satan, and
overthrew him. A characteristically oriental fast of forty days in the
wilderness equipped him for this feat. Thenceforth he displayed, like
Apollonius of Tyana and not a few contemporary rabbis, considerable
familiarity with the demons of disease and madness. The sick flocked to
him to be healed, and it was only in districts where people disbelieved
in him and his message that his therapeutic energy met with a check.
Among those who particularly flouted his pretensions were his mother
and brethren, who on one occasion at least followed him in order to
arrest him and put him under restraint as being beside himself or
<i lang="fr">exalt&eacute;</i>. <span class="marginnote">His Parables
all turn on the coming Kingdom</span>A good many parables are
attributed to him in this Gospel, and yet more in Matthew and Luke, of
which the burden usually is the near approach of the dissolution of
this world and of the last Judgment, which are to usher in the Kingdom
of God on earth. We learn that the parable was his favourite mode of
instruction, as it always has been and still is the chosen vehicle of
Semitic moral teaching. <span class="marginnote">No hint in the
earliest sources of the miraculous birth of Jesus</span>Of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>later legend of his supernatural birth, and of the
visits before his birth of angels to Mary, his mother, and to Joseph,
his putative father, of the portents subsequently related in connection
with his birth at Bethlehem, there is not a word either in Mark or in
the other early document out of which Matthew and Luke supplemented
Mark. In these earliest documents Jesus is presented quite naturally as
the son of Joseph and his wife Mary, and we learn quite incidentally
the names of his brothers and sisters.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Late recognition of Jesus as himself the
Messiah</span>Towards the middle of his career Jesus seems to have been
recognized by Peter as the Son of God or Messiah. Whether he put
himself forward for that <i>r&ocirc;le</i> we cannot be sure; but so
certain were his Apostles of the matter that two of them are
represented as having asked him in the naivest way to grant them seats
of honour on his left and right hand, when he should come in glory to
judge the world. The Twelve expected to sit on thrones and judge the
twelve tribes of Israel, and this idea meets us afresh in the
Apocalypse, a document which in the form we have it belongs to the
years 92&ndash;93.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">His hopes shattered at approach of
death</span>But the simple faith of the Apostles in their teacher and
leader was to receive a rude shock. They accompany him for the Passover
to Jerusalem. An insignificant triumphal demonstration is organized for
him as he enters the sacred city on an ass; he beards the priests in
the temple, and scatters the money-changers who sat there to change
strange coins for pilgrims. The priests, who, like many others of their
kind, were much too comfortable to sigh for the end of the world, and
regarded enthusiasts as nuisances, took offence, denounced him to
Pilate as a rebel and a danger to the Roman government of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>Jud&aelig;a. He is arrested, condemned to be
crucified, and as he hangs on the cross in a last moment of
disillusionment utters that most pathetic of cries: &ldquo;My God, my
God, why hast thou forsaken me?&rdquo; He had expected to witness the
descent of the kingdom on earth, but instead thereof he is himself
handed over helpless into the hands of the Gentiles.</p>
<p>Such in outline is the story Mark has to tell. The rival and
supplementary document of which I have spoken, and which admits of some
reconstruction from the text of Matthew and Luke, consisted mainly of
parables and precepts which Jesus was supposed to have delivered. It
need not engage our attention here.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The mythical theory of Jesus</span>Now the
three writers I have named&mdash;Messrs. Drews, Robertson, and W. B.
Smith&mdash;enjoy the singular good fortune to be the first to have
discovered what the above narratives really mean, and of how they
originated; and they are urgent that we should sell all we have, and
purchase their pearl of wisdom. They assure us that in the Gospels we
have not got any &ldquo;tradition of a personality.&rdquo; Jesus, the
central figure, never existed at all, but was a purely mythical
personage. The mythical character of the Gospels, so Drews assures us,
has, in the hands of Mr. J. M. Robertson, led the way, and made a
considerable advance in England; he regrets that so far official
learning in Germany has not taken up a serious position regarding the
mythic symbolical interpretation of the latter.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e602src" href="#xd25e602" name="xd25e602src">3</a> Let us then
ask, What <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>is the gist of the new system of interpretation.
It is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Jesus = Joshua, a Sun-god, object of a
secret cult</span>Jesus, or Joshua, was the name under which the
expected Messiah was honoured in a certain Jewish secret society which
had its headquarters in Jerusalem about the beginning of our era. In
view of its secret character Drews warns us not to be too curious, nor
to question either his information or that of Messrs. Smith and
Robertson. This recalls to me an incident in my own experience. I was
once, together with a little girl, being taken for a sail by an old
sailor who had many yarns. One of the most circumstantial of them was
about a ship which went down in mid ocean with all hands aboard; and it
wound up with the remark: &ldquo;And nobody never knew nothing about
it.&rdquo; Little girl: &ldquo;Then how did you come to hear all about
it?&rdquo; Like our brave old sailor, Dr. Drews warns us (p. 22) not to
be too inquisitive. We must not &ldquo;forget that we are dealing with
a secret cult, the existence of which we can decide upon only by
indirect means.&rdquo; His hypothesis, he tells us, &ldquo;can only be
rejected without more ado by such as seek the traces of the
pre-Christian cult of Jesus in well-worn places, and will only allow
that to be &lsquo;proved&rsquo; which they have established by direct
original documentary evidence before their eyes.&rdquo; In other words,
we are to set aside our copious and almost (in Paul&rsquo;s case)
contemporary evidence that Jesus was a real person in favour of a
hypothesis which from the first and as such lacks all direct and
documentary evidence, and is not amenable to any of the methods of
proof recognized by sober historians. We must take Dr. Drews&rsquo;s
word for it, and forego all evidence.</p>
<p>But let our authors continue with their new revelation. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>By
Joshua, or Jesus, we are not to understand the personage concerning
whose exploits the Book of Joshua was composed, but a Sun-god. The
Gospels are a veiled account of the sufferings and exploits of this
Sun-god. &ldquo;Joshua is apparently [why this qualification?] an
ancient Ephraimitic god of the Sun and Fruitfulness, who stood in close
relation to the Feast of the Pasch and to the custom of
circumcision.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e620src" href=
"#xd25e620" name="xd25e620src">4</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Emptiness of the Sun-god Joshua
hypothesis</span>Now no one nowadays accepts the Book of Joshua offhand
as sound history. It is a compilation of older sources, which have
already been sifted a good deal, and will undergo yet more sifting in
the future. The question before us does not concern its historicity,
but is this: Does the Book of Joshua, whether history or not, support
the hypothesis that Joshua was ever regarded as God of the Sun and of
Fruitfulness? Was ever such a god known of or worshipped in the tribe
of Ephraim or in Israel at large? In this old Hebrew epic or saga
Joshua is a man of flesh and blood. How did these gentlemen get it into
their heads that he was a Sun-god? For this statement there is not a
shadow of evidence. They have invented it. As he took the Israelites
dryshod over the Jordan, why have they not made a River-god of him? And
as, according to Drews, he was so interested in fruitfulness and
foreskins, why not suppose he was a Priapic god? They are much too
modest. We should at least expect &ldquo;the composite myth&rdquo; to
include this element, inasmuch as his mystic votaries at Jerusalem
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>were far from seeing eye to eye with Paul in the
matter of circumcision.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Sun-myth stage of comparative
mythology</span>There was years ago a stage in the Comparative History
of Religions when the Sun-myth hypothesis was invoked to explain almost
everything. The shirt of Nessus, for example, in which Heracles
perished, was a parable of the sun setting amidst a wrack of scattered
clouds. The Sun-myth was the key which fitted every lock, and was
employed unsparingly by pioneers of comparative mythology like F. Max
M&uuml;ller and Sir George Cox. It was taken for granted that early man
must have begun by deifying the great cosmic powers, by venerating Sun
and Moon, the Heavens, the Mountains, the Sea, as holy and divine
beings, because they, rather than humble and homelier objects, impress
us moderns by their sublimity and overwhelming force. Man was supposed
from the first to have felt his transitoriness, his frailty and
weakness, and to have contrasted therewith the infinities of space and
time, the majesty of the starry hosts of heaven, the majestic and
uniform march of sun and moon, the mighty rumble of the thunder. Max
M&uuml;ller thought that religion began when the cowering savage was
crushed by awe of nature and of her stupendous forces, by the infinite
lapses of time, by the yawning abysses of space. As a matter of fact,
savages do not entertain these sentiments of the dignity and majesty of
nature. On the contrary, a primitive man thinks that he can impose his
paltry will on the elements; that he knows how to unchain the wind, to
oblige the rain to fall; that he can, like the ancient witches of
Thessaly, control sun and moon and stars by all sorts of petty magical
rites, incantations, and gestures, as Joshua <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>made the
sun stand still till his band of brigands had won the battle. It is to
the imagination of us moderns alone that the grandeur of the universe
appeals, and it was relatively late in the history of religion&mdash;so
far as it can be reconstructed from the scanty data in our
possession&mdash;that the higher nature cults were developed. The gods
and sacred beings of an Australian or North American native are the
humble vegetables and animals which surround him, objects with which he
is on a footing of equality. His totems are a duck, a hare, a kangaroo,
an emu, a lizard, a grub, or a frog. In the same way, the sacred being
of an early Semite&rsquo;s devotion was just as likely to be a pig or a
hare as the sun in heaven; the cult of an early Egyptian was centred
upon a crocodile, or a cat, or a dog.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e640src" href="#xd25e640" name="xd25e640src">5</a> In view of
these considerations, our suspicion is aroused at the outset by finding
Messrs. Drews and Robertson to be in this discarded and obsolete
Sun-myth stage of speculation. They are a back number. Let us, however,
examine their mythic symbolic theory a little further, and see what
sort of arguments they invoke in favour of it, and what their
&ldquo;indirect&rdquo; proofs amount to.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Examples of the Sun-god theory of Jesus.
The Rock-Tomb</span>Why was Jesus buried in a rock-tomb? asks Mr.
Robertson. Answer: Because he was Mithras, the rock-born Sun-god. We
would like to know what other sort of burial was possible round
Jerusalem, where soil was so scarce that everyone was buried in a
rock-tomb. Scores of such tombs remain. Are they all Mithraic? Surely a
score of other considerations would equally well explain the choice of
a rock-tomb for him in Christian tradition. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The date of birthday</span>Why was Jesus
born at the winter-solstice? Answer: Because he was a Sun-god.</p>
<p>Our author forgets that the choice of December 25 for the feast of
the physical birth of Jesus was made by the Church as late as 354
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> What could the cryptic Messianists of the
first half of the first century know about a festival which was never
heard of in Rome until the year 354, nor accepted in Jerusalem before
the year 440? Time is evidently no element in the calculations of these
authors; and they commit themselves to the most amazing anachronisms
with the utmost insouciance, or, shall we not rather say, ignorance;
unless, indeed, they imagine that the mystic worshippers of the God
Joshua knew all about the date, but kept it dark in order to mystify
all succeeding generations.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The twelve disciples</span> Why did Jesus
surround himself with twelve disciples? Answer: Because they were the
twelve signs of the Zodiac and he a Sun-god. We naturally ask, Were the
twelve tribes of Israel equally representative of the Zodiac? In any
case, may not Christian story have fixed the number of Apostles at
twelve in view of the tribes being twelve? It is superfluous to go as
far as the Zodiac for an explanation.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Sermon on the Mount</span> Why did
Jesus preach his sermon on the Mount? Answer: Because as Sun-god he had
to take his stand on the &ldquo;pillar of the world.&rdquo; In the same
way, Moses, another Sun-god, gave his law from the Mount.</p>
<p>I always have heard that Moses got his tables of the law up top of a
mountain, and brought them down to a people that were forbidden to
approach it. He did not stand up top, and shout out his laws to them,
as Mr. Robertson suggests. In any case, we merely read in <a class=
"biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%205&amp;version=NRSV">Matthew
v</a> that Jesus went up into a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21"
href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>mountain or upland region, and
when he had sat down his disciples came to him, and he then opened his
mouth and taught them. In a country like Galilee, where you can barely
walk a mile in any direction without climbing a hill, what could be
more natural than for a narrator to frame such a setting for the
teacher&rsquo;s discourse? It is the first rule of criticism to
practise some economy of hypothesis, and not go roaming after fanciful
and extravagant interpretations of quite commonplace and every-day
occurrences.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The last Judgment</span> Why was it
believed that Jesus was to judge men after death? Answer: Because he
was a Sun-god, and <i lang="la">pro tanto</i> identical with
Osiris.</p>
<p>Surely the more natural interpretation is that, so soon as Jesus was
identified in the minds of his followers with the Messiah or Christ,
the task of judging Israel was passed on to him as part of the
<i>r&ocirc;le</i>. Thus in the Psalms of Solomon, a Jewish apocryph of
about <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 50, we read that the Messiah will
&ldquo;in the assemblies judge the peoples, the tribes of the
sanctified&rdquo; (xvii, 48). Such references could be multiplied; are
they all Osirian? If Mr. Robertson had paid a little more attention to
the later apocrypha of Judaism, and made himself a little better
acquainted with the social and religious medium which gave birth to
Christianity, he would have realized how unnecessary are these
Sun-mythic hypotheses, and we should have been spared his books.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Lamb and Fish symbolism</span> Why is
Jesus represented in art and lore by the Lamb and the Fishes? Answer:
As a Sun-god passing through the Zodiac.</p>
<p>This is amazing. We know the reason why Jesus was figured as a Lamb
by the early Christians. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href=
"#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>was because they regarded the paschal
lamb as a type of him. Does Mr. Robertson claim to know the reasons of
their symbolism better than they did themselves?</p>
<p>And where did he discover that Jesus was represented as
<i>Fishes</i> in Art and Lore? He was symbolized as one fish, not as
several; and Tertullian has told us why. It was because, according to
the popular zoology of the day, fishes were supposed to be born and to
originate in the water, without carnal connection between their
parents. For this reason the fish was taken as a symbol of Jesus, who
was born again in the waters of the Jordan. A later generation
explained the appellation of <span class="trans" title=
"ichthys"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#7984;&chi;&theta;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span></span>
(<i>ichthus</i>), or Fish, as an acrostic. The letters of the Greek
word are the initials of the words: <i lang="grc-latn">Iesous Christos
Theou uios soter</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Jesus Christ of God Son,
Saviour; but this later explanation came into vogue in an age when it
was already heretical to say that Jesus was reborn in baptism; nor does
it explain why the multitude of the baptized were symbolized as little
fishes in contrast with the Big Fish, Christ.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The two asses</span> Why did Jesus ride
into Jerusalem before his death on two asses? Answer: Because Dionysus
also rides on an ass and a foal in one of the Greek signs of Cancer
(the turning point in the sun&rsquo;s course). &ldquo;Bacchus (p. 287)
crossed a marsh on two asses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Robertson does not attempt to prove that the earliest
Christians, who were Jews, must have been familiar with the rare legend
of Bacchus crossing a marsh on two asses; still less with the rare
representation of the zodiacal sign Cancer as an ass and its foal. It
is next to impossible; and, even if they were, what induced them to
transform the myth into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href=
"#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>the legend of Jesus riding into
Jerusalem on two donkeys at once? If they had so excellent a legend of
Bacchus on his asses crossing a marsh, why not be content with it? And
the same question may be asked in regard to all the other
transformations by which these &ldquo;mystic sectaries,&rdquo; who
formed the early Church, changed myths culled from all times and all
religions and races into a connected story of Jesus, as it lies before
us in the Synoptic Gospels.</p>
<p>Mr. Robertson disdains any critical and comparative study of the
Gospels, and insists on regarding them as coeval and independent
documents. Everything inside the covers of the New Testament is for
him, as for the Sunday-school teacher, on one dead level of importance.
All textual criticism has passed over his head. He has never learned to
look in Mark for the original form of a statement which Luke or Matthew
copied out, and in transferring them to their Gospels scrupled not to
alter or modify. Accordingly, to suit the exigencies of his theory that
the Gospels are an allegory of a Sun-god&rsquo;s exploits, he here
claims to find the original text not in Mark, but in Matthew; as if a
transcript and paraphrase could possibly be prior to, and more
authoritative than, the text transcribed and <i>brod&eacute;</i>.
Accordingly, he writes (p. 339) as follows: &ldquo;In <a class=
"biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2011&amp;version=NRSV">
Mark xi</a> and <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2019:30&amp;version=NRSV">
Luke xix, 30</a>, the two asses <i>become</i> one&#8202;&hellip;. In
the Fourth Gospel, again, we have simply the colt.&rdquo; And yet by
all rules of textual criticism and of common sense the underlying and
original text is <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2011:1-7&amp;version=NRSV">
Mark xi, 1&ndash;7</a>. In it the disciples merely bring a colt which
they had found tied at a door. The author of the Gospel called of
Matthew, eager to discern in every incident, no matter how commonplace,
which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>he found in Mark, a fulfilment of some prophecy,
or another, drags in a tag of Zechariah: &ldquo;Behold, the King cometh
to thee, meek, and riding on an ass and upon a colt, the foal of an
ass.&rdquo; Then, to make the story told of Jesus run on all fours with
the prophecy, he writes that the disciples &ldquo;brought the ass and
the colt, and put on them their garments, and he (Jesus) sat on
them.&rdquo; He was unacquainted with Hebrew idiom, and so not aware
that the words, &ldquo;a colt the foal of an ass,&rdquo; are no more
than a rhetorical reduplication<a class="noteref" id="xd25e750src"
href="#xd25e750" name="xd25e750src">6</a> of <i>an ass</i>. There was,
then, but one animal in the original form of the story, and, as the
French say, it <i lang="fr">saute aux yeux</i> that the importation of
two is due to the influence of the prophecy on the mind of the
transcriber. Why, therefore, go out of the way to attribute the tale to
the influence of a legend of Bacchus, so multiplying empty hypotheses?
Mr. Robertson, with hopeless perversity, takes Dr. Percy Gardner to
task for repeating what he calls &ldquo;the fallacious explanation,
that &lsquo;an ass and the foal of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25"
href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>an ass&rsquo; represents a Greek
misconception of the Hebrew way of saying &lsquo;an ass,&rsquo; as if
Hebrews in every-day life lay under a special spell of verbal
absurdity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e769src" href="#xd25e769"
name="xd25e769src">7</a> <span class="marginnote">Jewish abhorrence of
Pagan myths</span>But did Hebrews in every-day life mould their ideas
of the promised Messiah on out-of-the-way legends of Bacchus? Were they
likely to fashion a tale of a Messianic triumph out of Gentile myths?
Do we not know from a hundred sources that the Jews of that age, and
the Christians who were in this matter their pupils, abhorred
everything that savoured of Paganism. They were the last people in the
world to construct a life of the Messiah out of the myths of Bacchus,
and Hermes, and Osiris, and Heracles, and the fifty other heathen gods
and heroes whom Mr. Robertson rolls up into what he calls the
&ldquo;composite myth&rdquo; of the Gospels. But let us return to his
criticism of Dr. Gardner. Why, it may be asked, was it <i>&agrave;
priori</i> more absurd of Matthew to turn one ass into two in deference
to Hebrew prophecy, than for Hebrews to set their Messiah riding into
the holy city on two asses in deference to a myth of Bacchus crossing a
marsh on two of them? Is it not Mr. Robertson, rather than <span class=
"marginnote">Robertson on Drs. Gardner and Carpenter</span>Dr. Gardner,
who here lies under a special spell of absurdity? &ldquo;A glance at
the story of Bacchus,&rdquo; writes Mr. Robertson, &ldquo;crossing a
marsh on two asses &hellip; would have shown him that he was dealing
with a zodiacal myth.&rdquo; The boot is on the other foot. Had Mr.
Robertson chosen to glance at the <i lang="la">Poeticon
Astronomicon</i> of Hyginus, a late and somewhat worthless Latin
author, who is the authority for this particular tale of Bacchus, he
would have read <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>(ii, 23) how Liber (<i>i.e.</i>, Dionysus) was on
his way to get an oracle at Dodona which might restore his lost sanity:
<i lang="la">Sed cum venisset ad quandam paludem magnam, quam transire
non posset, de quibusdam duobus asellis obviis factis dicitur unum
deprehendisse eorum, et ita esse transvectus, ut omnino aquam non
tetigerit.</i></p>
<p>In English: &ldquo;But when he came to a certain spacious marsh,
which he thought he could not get across, he is said to have met on the
way two young asses, of which he caught one, and he was carried across
on it so nicely that he never touched the water at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here there is no hint of Bacchus riding on two asses, and Mr.
Robertson&rsquo;s entire hypothesis falls to the ground like a house of
cards. The astounding thing is that, although he insists on pages 287
and 453<a class="noteref" id="xd25e800src" href="#xd25e800" name=
"xd25e800src">8</a> that Bacchus rode on two asses, and that here is
the true Babylonian explanation of Jesus also riding on two, he gets
the Greek, or rather Latin, myth right on p. 339, and recognizes that
Dionysus was only mounted on one of the asses when he passed the morass
or river on his way to Dodona. Thus, by Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s own
admission, Bacchus never rode on two asses at all.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Pilate myth</span> Why was Jesus
crucified by Pilate? For an answer to this let us for a little quit
&ldquo;the very stimulating and informing works,&rdquo; as Dr. Drews
calls them, of Mr. Robertson, and turn to Dr. Drews&rsquo;s own work on
<i>The Witnesses to the Historicity of Jesus</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e810src" href="#xd25e810" name="xd25e810src">9</a> For there we
find the true &ldquo;astral myth interpretation&rdquo; in all
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>its glory. The Pilate of Christian legend was, so
we learn, not originally an historical person at all; the whole story
of Christ is to be taken in an astral sense; and Pilate in particular
represents the story of Orion, the javelin-man (Pilatus), with the
Arrow or Lance constellation (Sagitta), which is supposed to be very
long in the Greek myth, and reappears in the Christian legend under the
name of Longinus&#8202;&hellip;. In the astral myth the Christ hanging
on the cross or world-tree (<i>i.e.</i>, the Milky Way) is killed by
the lance of Pilatus&#8202;&hellip;. The Christian population of Rome
told the legend of a javelin-man, a <i>Pilatus</i>, who was supposed to
have been responsible for the death of the Saviour. Tacitus heard the
myth repeated, and, like the fool he was, took it that Pilate the
javelin-man was no other than Pilate the Roman procurator of
Jud&aelig;a under Tiberius, who must have been known to him from the
books of Josephus.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e824src" href="#xd25e824"
name="xd25e824src">10</a> Accordingly, Tacitus sat down and penned his
account of the wholesale massacre and burning of Christians by Nero in
the fifteenth book of his <i>Annals</i>.</p>
<p>We shall turn to the evidence of Tacitus later on. Meanwhile it is
pertinent to ask where the myth of Pilatus, of which Drews here makes
use, came from. The English text of Drews is somewhat confused; but
presumedly Orion, with his girdle sword and lion&rsquo;s skin, is no
other than Pilatus; and his long lance, with which he kills Christ,
further entitles him to the name of Longinus. Or is it Pilatus who
stabs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>Orion? It does not matter. Let us test this
hypothesis in its essential parts.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Longinus myth</span> Firstly, then,
Longinus was the name coined by Christian legend-mongers of the third
or fourth century for the centurion who stabbed Jesus with a lance as
he hung on the cross. How could so late a myth influence or form part
of a tradition three centuries older than itself? The incident of the
lance being plunged into the side of Jesus is related only in the
Fourth Gospel, and is not found in the earlier ones. The author of that
Gospel invented it in order to prove to his generation that Jesus had
real blood in his body, and was not, as the Docetes maintained, a
phantasm mimicking reality to the ears and eyes alone of those who saw
and conversed with him. This Gospel, even according to the Christian
tradition of its date, is barely earlier than <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 100, and the name <i>Longinus</i> was not heard of
before <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 250 at the earliest. Yet Drews is
ready to believe that it was on the lips of Christians in the reign of
Nero, say in <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 64.</p>
<p>Secondly, what evidence is there that Pilatus could mean the
&ldquo;javelin-man&rdquo; for the earliest generations of Roman
Christians? The language current among them was Greek, not Latin, as
the earliest Christian inscriptions in the catacombs of Rome testify.
The language of Roman rites and popes remained Greek for three
centuries. Why, then, should they have had their central myth of the
crucifixion in a Latin form?</p>
<p>Thirdly, what evidence is there that Pilatus could mean a
javelin-man even to a Latin? Many lexicographers interpret it in Virgil
in the sense of <i>packed together</i> or <i>dense</i>, and in most
authors it bears the sense of bald or despoiled. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Inadequacy of the mythic theory</span> But,
letting that pass, we ask what evidence is there that Orion ever had
the epithet Pilatus in this sense? What evidence that such a myth ever
existed at all? There is none, absolutely none. It is not enough for
these authors to ransack Lempri&egrave;re and other dictionaries of
mythology in behalf of their paradoxes; but when these collections fail
them, they proceed to coin myths of their own, and pretend that they
are ancient, that the early Christians believed in them, and that
Tacitus fell into the trap; as if these Christians, whom they
acknowledge to have been either Jews or the converts of Jews, had not
been constitutionally opposed to all pagan myths and cults alike; as if
a good half of the earliest Christian literature did not consist of
polemics against the pagan myths, which were regarded with the
bitterest scorn and abhorrence; as if it were not notorious that it was
their repugnance to and ridicule of pagan gods and heroes and religious
myths that earned for the Christians, as for the Jews, their teachers,
the hatred and loathing of the pagan populations in whose midst they
lived. And yet we are asked to believe that the Christian Church,
almost before it was separated from the Jewish matrix, fashioned for
itself in the form of the Gospels an allegory of a Sun-god Joshua, who,
though unknown to serious Semitic scholars, is yet so well known to Mr.
Robertson and his friends that he identifies him with Adonis, and
Osiris, and Dionysus, and Mithras, and Krishna, and Asclepius, and with
any other god or demi-god that comes to hand in
Lempri&egrave;re&rsquo;s dictionary. After hundreds of pages of such
fanciful writing, Drews warns us in solemn language against the
attempts &ldquo;of historical theologians to reach the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>nucleus
of the Gospels by purely philological means.&rdquo; The attempt, he
declares, is &ldquo;<i>hopeless</i>, and must remain hopeless, because
the Gospel tradition <i>floats in the air</i>.&rdquo; One would like to
know in what medium his own hypotheses float. <span class=
"marginnote">Joshua the Sun-god a pure invention of the mythic
school</span> Like Dr. Drews, Mr. Robertson adopts the Joshua myth as
if it were beyond question. His faith in &ldquo;the ancient Palestinian
Saviour-Sun-God&rdquo; is absolute. This otherwise unknown deity was
the core of what is gracefully styled &ldquo;the Jesuist myth.&rdquo;
On examination, however, the Joshua Sun-god turns out to be the most
rickety of hypotheses. Because the chieftain who, in old tradition, led
the Jews across the Jordan into the land of promise was named Joshua,
certain critics, who are still in the sun-myth phase of comparative
mythology&mdash;in particular, Stade and Winckler&mdash;have
conjectured that the name Joshua conceals a solar hero worshipped
locally by the tribe of Ephraim. Even if there ever existed such a
cult, it had long vanished when the book of Joshua was compiled; for in
this he is no longer represented as a solar hero, but has become in the
popular tradition a human figure, a hero judge, and leader of the
armies of Israel. Of a Joshua cult the book does not preserve any trace
or memory; that it ever existed is an improbable and unverifiable
hypothesis. We might just as well conjecture that Romulus, and Remus,
and other half or wholly legendary figures of ancient history, were
sun-gods and divine saviours. But it is particularly in Jewish history
that this school is apt to revel. Moses, and Joseph, and David were all
mythical beings brought down to earth; and the god David and the god
Joshua, the god Moses, the god Joseph, form in the imagination of these
gentlemen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>a regular Hebrew prehistoric Pantheon. I say in
their imagination, for it is certain that when the Pentateuch was
compiled&mdash;at the latest in the fifth century <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>&mdash;the Jews no longer revered David, and Joshua,
and Joseph as sun-gods; while of what they worshipped even locally
before that date we have little knowledge, and can form only
conjectures. In any case, that they continued to worship a sun-god
under the name of Joshua as late as the first century of our era must
strike anyone who has the least knowledge of Hebrew religious
development, who has ever read Philo or Josephus, or studied Jewish
sapiential and apocalyptic literature of the period <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span> 200&ndash;<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 100, as a
wildly improbable supposition. <span class="marginnote">Supposed
secrecy of early Christian cult a literary trick</span> Sensible that
their hypothesis conflicts with all we know about the Jews of these
three centuries, these three authors&mdash;Messrs. Drews, Robertson,
and W. B. Smith&mdash;insist on the esoterism and secrecy of the
cryptic society which in Jerusalem harboured the cult. This commonest
of literary tricks enables them to evade any awkward questions, and
whenever they are challenged to produce some evidence of the existence
of such a cult they can answer that, being secret and esoteric, it
could leave little or no evidence of itself, and that we must take
their <i lang="la">ipse dixit</i> and renounce all hope of direct and
documentary evidence. They ask of us a greater credulity than any Pope
of Rome ever demanded.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Joshua ben Jehozadak also a Sun-god</span>
The divine stage of Joshua, then, if it ever existed, was past and
forgotten as early as 500 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> It has left no
traces. Of the other Joshuas, who meet us in the pages of the Jewish
scriptures, the most important one is Jeshua or Joshua ben Jehozadak, a
high priest who, together with Zerubbabel, is often mentioned
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>(according to the <i lang="la">Encyclop&aelig;dia
Biblica</i>) in <i>contemporary</i> writings. Not only, then, have we
contemporary evidence of this Joshua as of a mere man and a priest, but
we know from it that he stooped to such mundane occupations as the
rebuilding of the Temple. He also had human descendants, who are traced
in <a class="biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Neh%2012:10&amp;version=NRSV">
Nehemiah xii, 10</a> fol. down to Jaddua. Of this epoch of Jewish
history, in which the Temple was being rebuilt, we have among the
Jewish and Aramaic papyri lately recovered at Elephantine documents
that are autographs of personages with whom this Joshua may well have
been in contact. His contemporaries are mentioned and even addressed in
these documents, so that he and his circle are virtually as well
evidenced for us as Frederick the Great and Voltaire. Is it credible in
the face of such facts that the authors we are criticizing should turn
this Joshua, too, into a solar god? Yet Drews turns with zest to the
notice of this Joshua, the high priest in <a class="biblink xd25e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zec%203&amp;version=NRSV">
Zechariah iii</a>, as &ldquo;one of the many signs&rdquo; which attest
that &ldquo;Joshua or Jesus was the name under which the expected
Messiah was honoured in certain Jewish sects.&rdquo; Unless he regards
this later Joshua also as a divine figure, and no mere man of flesh and
blood, why does he thus drag him into his argument?</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The suspicion that the compilers of the Old
Testament burked evidence favourable to the Sun-myth hypothesis</span>
But, after all, Messrs. Drews and Robertson are uneasy about the book
of Joshua, and not altogether capable of the breezy optimism of their
instructor, Mr. W. B. Smith, who, in <i lang="la">Ecce Deus</i> (p.
74), commits himself to the naive declaration that, &ldquo;even if we
had no evidence whatever of a pre-Christian Jesus cult, we should be
compelled to affirm its existence with undiminished decision.&rdquo;
Accordingly, they both go out of their way to hint that the ancient
Jews <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>suppressed the facts of the Joshua or Jesus
Sun-God-Saviour cult. Thus Mr. Robertson (<i>Christianity and
Mythology</i>, p. 99, note 1), after urging us to accept a late and
worthless tradition about Joshua, the Son of Nave, remarks that
&ldquo;the Jewish books would naturally drop the subject.&rdquo; How
ill-natured, to be sure, of the authors of the old Hebrew scriptures to
suppress evidence that would have come in so handy for Mr.
Robertson&rsquo;s speculations. Dr. Drews takes another line, and in a
note draws our attention to the fact that the Samaritans possessed an
apocryphal book of the same name as the canonical book of Joshua. This
book, he informs us, is based upon an old work composed in the third
century <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, containing stories which in part
do not appear in our Book of Joshua.</p>
<p>He here suggests that something was omitted in canonical Joshua by
its authors which would have helped out his hypothesis of a Joshua
Sun-god cult. He will not, however, find the Samaritan book
encouraging, for it gives no hint of such a cult; of that anyone who
does not mind being bored by a perusal of it can satisfy himself.
Drews&rsquo;s statement that it is based on an old work composed in the
third century <span class="sc">B.C.</span> is founded on pure
ignorance, and the <i lang="la">Encyclop&aelig;dia Biblica</i> declares
it to be a medieval production of no value to anyone except the student
of the Samaritan sect under Moslem rule.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The evidence of El Tabari about
Joshua</span> Mr. Robertson thinks he has got on a better trail in the
shape of a tradition as to Joshua which he is quite sure the old Jewish
scripture writers suppressed. Let us examine it, for it affords a
capital example of his ideas of what constitutes historical evidence.
&ldquo;Eastern tradition,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;preserves a variety
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>of myths that the Bible-makers <i>for obvious
reasons</i> suppressed or transformed.&rdquo; In one of those
traditions &ldquo;Joshua is the son of the mythical Miriam; that is to
say, there was probably an ancient Palestinian Saviour-Sun-God, Jesus,
the son of Mary.&rdquo; So on p. 285 we learn that the cult of Jesus of
Nazareth was &ldquo;the Survival of an ancient solar or other worship
of a Babe Joshua, son of Miriam.&rdquo; And he continually alludes to
this ancient form of devotion, not as a mere hypothesis, but as a
well-ascertained and demonstrable fact.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e950src" href="#xd25e950" name="xd25e950src">11</a></p>
<p>Let us then explore this remarkable tradition by which &ldquo;we are
led to surmise that the elucidation of the Christ myth is not yet
complete.&rdquo; For such is the grandiose language in which he heralds
his discovery. And what does it amount to? An Arab, El Tabari, who died
in Bagdad about the year 925, compiled a Chronicle, of which some
centuries later an unknown native of Persia made an abridgement in his
own tongue, and inserted in it as a gloss &ldquo;the remarkable Arab
tradition,&rdquo; as it is called in the <i>Pagan Christs</i> (p. 157)
of Mr. Robertson, albeit he acknowledges in a footnote that it is
&ldquo;not in the Arabic original.&rdquo; He asks us accordingly, on
the faith of an unknown Persian glossator of the late Middle Ages, to
believe that the canonical Book of Joshua originally contained this
absurd tradition, and why? Because it would help out his hypothesis
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>Jesus was an ancient Palestinian Saviour-Sun-God,
worshipped by a cryptic society of Hebrews in Jerusalem, both before
and after the beginning of the Christian era; and this is the man who
writes about &ldquo;the psychological resistance to evidence&rdquo; of
learned men, and sets it down to &ldquo;malice and impercipience&rdquo;
that anyone should challenge his conclusions. As usual, Dr. Drews, who
sets Mr. Robertson on a level with the author of the <i>Golden
Bough</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e962src" href="#xd25e962" name=
"xd25e962src">12</a> as a &ldquo;leading exponent of his new
mythico-symbolical method,&rdquo; plunges into the pit which Mr.
Robertson has dug for him, and writes that, &ldquo;according to an
ancient <i>Arabian</i> tradition, the mother of Joshua was called
Mirzam (Mariam, Maria, as the mother of Jesus was).&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">W. B. Smith&rsquo;s hypothesis of a God
Joshua</span> The source from which Messrs. Drews and Robertson have
drawn this particular inspiration is Dr. W. B. Smith&rsquo;s work,
<i>The Pre-Christian Jesus</i> (<i lang="de">Der Vorchristliche
Jesus</i>). This book, we are told, &ldquo;first systematically set
forth the case for the thesis of its title.&rdquo; Let us, therefore,
consider its main argument. We have the following passages in <a class=
"biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2018:24-28&amp;version=NRSV">
Acts xviii, 24</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by
race, a learned man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the
Scriptures. This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and,
being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught carefully the things
concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John: and he began to
speak boldly in the synagogue. But <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36"
href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>when Priscilla and Aquila heard
him, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God
more carefully. And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the
brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: and
when he was come, he helped them much which had believed through grace:
for he powerfully confuted the Jews, publicly, showing by the
Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Availing ourselves of the canons of interpretation laid down by
Drews and Robertson, we may paraphrase the above somewhat as follows by
way of getting at its true meaning:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A certain sun-myth hero, as his name Apollos signifies, came
to Ephesus, which, being the centre of Astarte or Aphrodite worship,
was obviously the right place for such a hero to pilgrimage unto. He
was mighty in the Jewish Scriptures, and had been instructed in the way
of the Lord Joshua, the Sun-God-Saviour of ancient Ephraim. He spake
and taught carefully the things concerning this Joshua (or Adonis, or
Osiris, or Dionysus, or Vegetation-god, or Horus&mdash;for you can take
your choice among these and many more). But he knew only of the
prehistoric ritual of baptism of Cadmus or of Oannes-Ea, the ancient
culture-god of the Babylonians, who appeared in the form of a Fish-man,
teaching men by day and at night going down into the sea&mdash;in his
capacity of Sun-god.&rdquo; This Cadmus or Oannes was worshipped at
Jerusalem in the cryptic sect of the <i>Christists</i> or
<i>Jesuists</i> under the name of John. His friend Apollos, the solar
demi-god, began to speak boldly in the synagogue. Priscilla (presumably
Cybele, mother of the gods), and Aquila, the Eagle-God, or Jupiter,
heard him; she took him forthwith and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>expounded to him the way
of Jahve, who also was identical with Joshua, the Sun-god, with Osiris,
etc.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">His forced and far-fetched interpretations
of common phrases</span> Professor W. B. Smith is a little more modest
and less thorough-going in his application of mythico-symbolic methods.
He only asks us to believe that the trite and hackneyed phrase,
&ldquo;the things concerning Jesus,&rdquo; refers not, as the context
requires, to the history and passion of Jesus of Galilee, but to the
mysteries of a prehistoric Saviour-God of the same name. We advisedly
say <i>prehistoric</i>, for he was never mentioned by anyone before
Professor Smith discovered him. The name Jesus, according to him, means
what the word Essene also meant, a <i>Healer</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1012src" href="#xd25e1012" name="xd25e1012src">13</a> Note, in
passing, that this etymology is wholly false, and rests on the
authority of a writer so late, ignorant, and superstitious as
Epiphanius. Now, why cannot the words, &ldquo;the things about
Jesus,&rdquo; in this context mean the tradition of the ministry of
Jesus as it had shaped itself at that time, beginning with the Baptism
and ending with the Ascension, as we read in <a class="biblink xd25e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201:22&amp;version=NRSV">
Acts i, 22</a>? <span class="marginnote">Apollos and the Baptism of
John</span>It cannot, argues Professor Smith, because Apollos only knew
the baptism of John. The reference to John&rsquo;s baptism may be
obscure, as much in early Christianity is bound to be obscure, except
to Professor Smith and his imitators. Yet this much is clear, that it
here means, what it means in the sequel, the baptism of mere repentance
as opposed to the baptism of the Spirit, which was by laying on of
hands, and conferred <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38"
name="pb38">38</a>]</span>the charismatic gifts of the Holy Ghost. The
Marcionites, and after them the Manichean and Cathar sects, retained
the latter rite, and termed it Spiritual or Pneumatic Baptism; while
they dropped as superfluous the Johannine baptism with water. It would
appear, then, that Apollos was perfectly acquainted with the personal
history of Jesus, and understood the purport of the baptism of
repentance as a sacrament preparing followers of Jesus for the kingdom
of Heaven, soon to be inaugurated on earth. Perhaps we get a glimpse in
this passage of an age when the mission of Jesus in his primitive
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> as herald of the Messianic kingdom and a mere
continuer of John&rsquo;s mission was familiar to many who yet did not
recognize him as the Messiah. For, after instruction by Priscilla and
Aquila, Apollos set himself to confute the Jews who denied Jesus to
have been Messiah, which, as a mere herald of the approaching kingdom
of God, he was not. We know that Paul regarded him as having attained
that dignity only through, and by, the fact of the Spirit having raised
him from the dead; and did not regard him as having received it through
the descent of the Spirit on him in the Jordan, as the oriental
Christians presently believed. Still less did Paul know of the later
teaching of the orthodox churches&mdash;viz., that the Annunciation was
the critical moment in which Christ became Jesus. In any case, we must
not interpret the words, &ldquo;the things about Jesus,&rdquo; in this
passage in a forced and unnatural sense wholly alien to the writer of
Acts. This writer again and again recapitulates the leading facts of
the life and ministry of Jesus, and the phrase, &ldquo;the things
concerning Jesus,&rdquo; cannot in any work of his bear any
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>other sense. Moreover, the same author uses the
very same phrase elsewhere (<a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:19&amp;version=NRSV">Luke
xxiv, 19</a>) in the same sense. Here Cleopas asks Jesus (whom he had
failed to recognize), and says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem, and not know the
things which are come to pass there in these days? And he said unto
him, What things? And they said unto him, <i>the things concerning
Jesus</i> of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word
before God and all the people: and how the chief priests and our rulers
delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such, then, were &ldquo;the things about Jesus,&rdquo; and to find
in them, as Professor W. B. Smith does, an allusion to a pre-Christian
myth of a God Joshua is to find a gigantic mare&rsquo;s-nest, and fly
in the face of all the evidence. He verges on actual absurdity when he
sees the same allusion in <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%205:26&amp;version=NRSV">
Mark v, 26</a>, where a sick woman, having heard &ldquo;the things
concerning Jesus,&rdquo; went behind him, touched his garment, and was
healed. Her disease was of a hysterical description, and in the annals
of faith-healing such cures are common. What she had heard of was
obviously not his fame as a Sun-god, but his power to heal sick persons
like herself. <span class="marginnote">Magical papyrus of
Wessely</span> Professor Smith tries to find support for his hardy
conjecture in a chance phrase in a magical papyrus of Paris, No. 3,009,
edited first by Wessely, and later by Dieterich in his <i>Abraxas</i>,
p. 138. It is a form of exorcism to be inscribed on a tin plate and
hung round the neck of a person possessed by a devil, or repeated over
him by an exorcist. In this rigmarole the giants, of course, are
dragged in, and the Tower of Babel and King Solomon; and the name of
Jesus, the God of the Hebrews, is also invoked in the following terms:
&ldquo;I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>adjure thee by Jesus the God of the Hebrews,
<span lang="he-latn">Iabaiae Abraoth aia thoth ele,
el&ocirc;</span>,&rdquo; etc. The age of this papyrus is unknown; but
Wessely puts it in the third century after Christ, while Dieterich
shows that it can in no case be older than the second century
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> It is clearly the composition of some
exorcist who clung on to the skirts of late Judaism, for he is at pains
to inform us in its last line that it is a Hebrew composition and
preserved among pure men. In that age, as in after ones, not a few
exorcists, trading on the fears and sufferings of superstitious people,
affected to be pure and holy; and the mention of Jesus indicates some
such charlatan, who was more or less cognisant of Christianity and of
the practice of Christian exorcists. He was also aware of the Jewish
antecedents of Christianity, and did not distinguish clearly between
the mother religion and its daughter. That is why he describes Jesus as
a Hebrew God. We know from other sources that even in the earliest
Christian age Gentiles used the name of Jesus in exorcisms. The author
of the document styles Jesus God, just as Pliny informs us that the
Christians sang hymns &ldquo;to Christ as to God&rdquo;&mdash;<i lang=
"la">Christo quasi deo</i>. How Professor Smith can imagine that this
papyrus lends any colour to his thesis of a pre-Christian Jesus it is
difficult to imagine.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Jesus a Nazor&aelig;an in what sense</span>
Still less does his thesis really profit by the text of <a class=
"biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%202:23&amp;version=NRSV">
Matthew ii, 23</a>, in which a prophecy is adduced to the effect that
the Messiah should be called a Nazor&aelig;an, and this prophecy is
declared to have been fulfilled in so far as Jesus was taken by his
parents to live at Nazareth in Galilee.</p>
<p>What prophecy the evangelist had in mind is not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>known.
But Professor W. B. Smith jumps to the conclusion that the Christians
were identical with the sect of Nazor&aelig;i mentioned in Epiphanius
as going back to an age before Christ; and he appeals in confirmation
of this quite gratuitous hypothesis<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1073src"
href="#xd25e1073" name="xd25e1073src">14</a> to <a class=
"biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2024:5&amp;version=NRSV">
Acts xxiv, 5</a>, where the following of Jesus is described as that of
the Nazor&aelig;i. It in no way helps the thesis of the non-historicity
of Jesus, even if he and his followers were members of this obscure
sect; it would rather prove the opposite. Drews, following W. B. Smith,
pretends in the teeth of the texts that the name is applied to Jesus
only as Guardian of the World, Protector and Deliverer of men from the
power of sins and d&aelig;mons, and that it has no reference to an
obscure and entirely unknown village named Nazareth. He also opines
that Jesus was called a Nazarene, because he was the promised Netzer or
Zemah who makes all things new, and so forth. Such talk is all in the
air. Why these writers boggle so much at the name <i>Nazor&aelig;an</i>
is not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>easy to divine; still less to understand what
Professor Smith is driving at when he writes of those whom he calls
&ldquo;historicists,&rdquo; that &ldquo;They have rightly felt that the
fall of Nazareth is the fall of historicism itself.&rdquo; Professor
Burkitt has suggested that Nazareth is Chorazin spelt backwards.
Wellhausen explains <i>Nazor&aelig;an</i> from <i>Nesar</i> in the name
Gennessaret. In any case, as we have no first-century gazetteer or
ordnance survey of Galilee, it is rash to suppose that there could have
been no town there of the name. True the Talmuds and the Old Testament
do not name it; but they do not profess to give a catalogue of all the
places in Galilee, so their silence counts for little.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1110src" href="#xd25e1110" name=
"xd25e1110src">15</a> All we know for certain is that for the

the word that sense when he met with it in an anonymous prophecy.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mr. Robertson on myths</span> I feel that I
ought almost to apologize to my readers for investigating at such
length the hypothesis of a pre-Christian Jesus, son of a mythical Mary,
and for exhibiting over so many pages its fantastic, baseless, and
absurd character. But Mr. Robertson himself warns us of the necessity
of showing no mercy to myths when they assume the garb of fact. For he
adduces (p. 126) the William Tell myth by way of illustrating once for
all &ldquo;the fashion in which a fiction can even in a historical
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>period find general acceptance.&rdquo; Even so it
is with his own fictions. We see them making their way with such
startling rapidity over England and Germany as almost to make one
despair of this age of popular enlightenment. It is not his fault, and
I exonerate him from blame. <span class="marginnote">His methods those
of old-fashioned orthodoxy</span>For centuries orthodox theologians
have been trying to get out of the Gospels supernaturalist conclusions
which were never in them, nor could with any colour be derived from
them except by deliberately ignoring the canons of evidence and the
historical methods freely employed in the study of all other ancient
monuments and narratives. They have set the example of treating the
early writings of Christianity as no other ancient books would be
treated. Mr. Robertson is humbly following in their steps, but <i lang=
"fr">&agrave; rebours</i>, or in an inverse sense. They insist on
getting more out of the New Testament than any historical testimony
could ever furnish; he on getting less. In other respects also he
imitates their methods. Thus they insist on regarding the New
Testament, and in particular the four Gospels, as a homogeneous block,
and will not hear of the criticism which discerns in them literary
development, which detects earlier and later <i>couches</i> of
tradition and narrative. This is what I call the Sunday-school
attitude, and it lacks all perspective and orientation. Mr. Robertson
imbibed it in childhood, and has never been able to throw it off. For
him there is no before and after in the formation of these books, no
earlier and later in the emergence of beliefs about Jesus, no
stratification of documents or of ideas. If he sometimes admits it, he
withdraws the admission on the next page, as militating against his
cardinal hypothesis. He seems never to have submitted himself
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>to systematic training in the methods of
historical research&mdash;never, as we say, to have gone through the
mill; and accordingly in the handling of documents he shows himself a
mere wilful child.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Thus he insists on the priority in
Christian tradition of the Virgin Birth legend</span> His treatment of
the legend of the Virgin Birth is an example of this mental attitude,
which might be described as orthodoxy turned upside down and inside
out. The Gospel of Mark is demonstrably older than those of the other
two synoptists who merely copied it out with such variations,
additions, omissions, and modifications as a growing reverence for
Jesus the Messiah imposed. It contains, no more than the Pauline
Epistles and the Johannine Gospel, any hint of the supernatural birth
of Jesus. It regards him quite simply and naturally as the son of
Joseph and Mary. In it the neighbours of Jesus enumerate by way of
contumely the names of his brothers and sisters. I have shown also in
my <i>Myth, Magic, and Morals</i> that this naturalist tradition of his
birth dominates no less the whole of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke
apart from the first two chapters of each, and that even in the first
chapter of Matthew the pedigree in early texts ended with the words
&ldquo;Joseph begat Jesus.&rdquo; I have shown furthermore that the
belief in the paternity of Joseph was the characteristic belief of the
Palestinian Christians for over two centuries, that it prevailed in
Syria to the extent of regarding Jesus and Thomas as twin brothers. I
have pointed out that the Jewish interlocutor Trypho in Justin
Martyr&rsquo;s dialogue (c. 150) maintains that Jesus was born a man of
men and rejects the Virgin Birth legend as a novelty unworthy of
monotheists, and that he extorts from his Christian antagonist the
admission that the great majority <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45"
href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>of Christians still believed in
the paternity of Joseph.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">His exceptional treatment of Christian
tradition</span> Now Mr. Robertson evidently reads a good deal, and
must at one time or another have come across all these facts. Why,
then, does he go out of his way to ignore them, and, in common with
Professors Drews and W. B. Smith, insist that the miraculous tradition
of Jesus&rsquo;s birth was coeval with the earliest Christianity and
prior to the tradition of a natural birth? Yet the texts stare him in
the face and confute him. Why does he shut his eyes to them, and gibe
perpetually at the critical students who attach weight to them? The
works of all the three writers are tirades against the critical method
which tries to disengage in the traditions of Jesus the true from the
false, fact from myth, and to show how, in the pagan society which, as
it were, lifted Jesus up out of his Jewish cradle, these myths
inevitably gathered round his figure, as mists at midday thicken around
a mountain crest.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">In secular history he uses other canons and
methods,</span> Their insistence that in the case of Christian origins
the miraculous and the non-miraculous form a solid block of
impenetrable myth is all the more remarkable, because in secular
history they are prepared, nay anxious, for the separation of truth
from falsehood, of history from myth, and continually urge not only its
possibility, but its necessity. Mr. Robertson in particular prides
himself on meting out to Apollonius of Tyana a measure which he refuses
to Jesus the Messiah. <span class="marginnote"><i>e.g.</i>, in
criticizing the story of Apollonius</span>&ldquo;The simple
purport,&rdquo; he writes in the <i>Literary Guide</i>, May 1, 1913,
&ldquo;of my chapter on Apollonius was to acknowledge his historicity,
despite the accretions of myth and more or less palpable fiction to his
biography.&rdquo; And yet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href=
"#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>there are ten testimonies to the
historicity of Jesus where there is one to that of Apollonius; yet
Apollonius was reputed to have been born miraculously, and his birth
accompanied by the portent of a meteor from heaven, as that of Jesus by
a star from the east. Like Jesus, he controlled the devils of madness
and disease, and by the power of his exorcisms dismissed them to be
tortured in hell. Like Peter, he miraculously freed himself from his
bonds; like Jesus, he revealed himself after death to a sceptical
disciple and <i lang="la">viva voce</i> convinced him of his ascent to
heaven; like him, he ascended in his body up to heaven amid the hymns
of maiden worshippers. In life he spent seven days in the bowels of the
earth, and gathered a band of disciples around him who acclaimed him as
a divine being; long after his death temples were raised to him as to a
demigod, miracles wrought by his relics, and prayer and sacrifice
offered to his genius. So considerable was the parallelism between his
story and that of Jesus that the pagan enemies of the Christians began
about the year 300 to run his cult against theirs, and it was only
yesterday that the orthodox began to give up the old view that the Life
of Apollonius was a blasphemous <i lang=
"fr">r&eacute;chauff&eacute;</i> of the Gospels. &ldquo;There is no
great reason to doubt that India was visited by Apollonius of
Tyana,&rdquo; writes Mr. Robertson (<i>Christianity and Mythology</i>,
p. 273); and yet his visit in the only relation we have of it is a
tissue of marvels and prodigies, his Indian itinerary is impossible,
and full of contradictions not only of what we know of Indian geography
to-day, but of what was already known in that day. Yet about his
pilgrimage thither, declares Mr. Robertson, there is no more
uncertainty than about the embassies <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>sent by Porus to
Augustus, and by the king of &ldquo;Taprobane&rdquo; to Claudius.
&ldquo;There is much myth,&rdquo; he writes again, p. 280, &ldquo;in
the life of Apollonius of Tyana, who appears to be at the bottom a real
historical personage.&rdquo; In the Gospels we have the story of
Jairus&rsquo;s daughter being raised to life from apparent death.
&ldquo;A closely similar story is found in Philostratus&rsquo;s Life of
Apollonius of Tyana, the girl in each case being spoken of in such a
way as to leave open the question of her having been dead or a
cataleptic.&rdquo; So writes Mr. Robertson, p. 334, who thinks that
&ldquo;the simple form preserved in Matthew suggests the derivation
from the story in Philostratus,&rdquo; overlooking here, as elsewhere,
the chronological difficulties. We can forgive him for that; but why,
we must ask, does the presence of such stories in the Gospel
irrevocably condemn Jesus to non-historicity, while their presence in
the Life of Apollonius leaves his historical reality intact and
unchallenged? Is it not that the application of his canons of
interpretation to Apollonius would have deprived him of one of the
sources from which the mythicity of Jesus by his anachronistic methods
could be deduced?</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The early passion play of the Sun-god
Joshua</span> Mr. Robertson endeavours in a halting manner to justify
his partiality for Apollonius. &ldquo;We have,&rdquo; he writes
(<i>Pagan Christs</i>, p. 283, &sect; 16), &ldquo;no reason for
doubting that there was an Apollonius of Tyana&#8202;&hellip;. The
reasons for not doubting are (1) that there was no cause to be served
by a sheer fabrication; and (2) that it was a much easier matter to
take a known name as a nucleus for a mass of marvels and theosophic
teachings than to build it up, as the phrase goes about the canon,
&lsquo;round a hole.&rsquo; The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48"
href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>difference between such a case
and those of Jesuism and Buddhism is obvious. In those cases there was
a cultus and an organization to be accounted for, and a biography of
the founder had to be forthcoming. In the case of Apollonius, despite
the string of marvels attached to his name, there was no
cultus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us examine the above argument. In the case of
&ldquo;Jesuism&rdquo; (Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s <i>argot</i> for early
Christianity) there had to be fabricated a biography of Jesus, because
there existed an organized sect that worshipped Jesus.</p>
<p>The organized sect consisted, according to Mr. Robertson, of
&ldquo;Christists&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jesuists,&rdquo; and the chief
incident for which they were organized was an annual play in which the
God Jesus was betrayed, arrested, condemned, was crucified, died, was
buried, and rose again. Ober Ammergau has supplied him with his main
conception, and his annually recurring &ldquo;Gospel mystery
play,&rdquo; as he imagines it to have been acted by the
&ldquo;Jesuists,&rdquo; who were immediate ancestors of the Christians,
is a faithful copy of the modern Passion Play. He supposes it to have
been acted annually because the hypothetical Sun-God-Saviour Joshua,
whose mythical sufferings and death it commemorated, was an analogue of
Osiris, whose sufferings and death were similarly represented in Egypt
each recurring spring; also of Adonis, of Dionysus, of Mithras, and of
sundry vegetation gods, annually slain to revive vegetation and secure
the life of the initiate in the next world. Be it remarked also that
the annually slain God of the Jesuists was not only an analogue of
these other gods, but a &ldquo;composite myth&rdquo; made up of their
myths. As we have seen, Mr. Robertson is ready to exhibit to us in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>one or another of their mythologies the original
of every single incident and actor in the Jesuist play.</p>
<p>Such was the cultus and organization which, according to Mr.
Robertson and his imitator Dr. Drews, lies behind the Christian
religion. The latter began to be when the &ldquo;Jesuist&rdquo; cult,
having broken away from Judaism, was also concerned to break away from
the paganism in contact with which the play would first arise.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Gospels a transcript of this
play</span> A biography of the Founder of the cult was now called for,
by the Founder oddly enough being meant the God himself, and not the
hierophant who instituted the play. The Christian Gospels are the
biography in question. They are a transcript of the annually performed
ritual drama, just as Lamb&rsquo;s <i>Tales from Shakespeare</i> are
transcripts of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays.</p>
<p>The first performances of the play, we learn, probably took place in
Egypt. It ceased to be acted when &ldquo;it was reduced to writing as
part of the gospel.&rdquo; How far away from Jerusalem it was that the
momentous decision was taken by the sect to give up play acting and be
content with the transcript Mr. Robertson &ldquo;can hardly
divine.&rdquo; He hints, however, that some of the latest
representations took place in the temples built by Herod at Damascus
and Jericho and in the theatres of the Greek town of Gadara. &ldquo;The
reduction of the play to narrative form put all the Churches on a
level, and would remove a stumbling block from the way of the ascetic
Christists who objected to all dramatic shows as such.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But where did the play come from? What inspired it? Mr. Robertson
makes a tour round the Mediterranean, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>and collects in Part II,
Ch. I, of his <i>Pagan Christs</i> a lot of scrappy information about
mock sacrifices and mystery dramas, all of them &ldquo;cases and modes
of modification&rdquo; of actual human sacrifices that were &ldquo;once
normal in the Semitic world.&rdquo; He assumes without a tittle of
proof, and against all probability, that the annual sacrifice of a king
or of a king&rsquo;s son, whether in real or mimic, held its ground
among Jews as a religious ceremony right down into our era, and was
&ldquo;reduced among them to ritual form, like the leading worships of
the surrounding Gentile world.&rdquo; He fashions a new hypothesis in
accordance with these earlier ones as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Joshua or Jesus slain once a year</span>
&ldquo;If in any Jewish community, or in the Jewish quarter of any
Eastern city, the central figure in this rite (<i>i.e.</i>, of a mock
sacrifice annually recurring of a man got up to represent a god) were
customarily called Jesus Barabbas, &lsquo;Jesus the Son of the
Father&rsquo;&mdash;whether or not in virtue of an old cultus of a God
Jesus who had died annually like Attis and Tammuz&mdash;we should have
a basis for the tradition so long preserved in many MSS. of the first
gospel, and at the same time a basis for the whole gospel myth of the
crucifixion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we have a whole string of hypotheses piled one on the other.
Let us see which have any ground in fact, or cohere with what we know
of the past, which are improbable and unproven.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Hypothesis of human sacrifice among
Jews</span> That human sacrifice was once in vogue among the Jews is
probable enough, and the story of the frustrated sacrifice of Isaac was
no doubt both a memory and a condemnation of the old rite of
sacrificing first-born children with which we are familiar in ancient
Ph&oelig;nicia and her colony of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51"
href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>Carthage. That such rites in
Jud&aelig;a and in Israel did not survive the Assyrian conquest of
Jerusalem is certain. The latest allusion to them is in <a class=
"biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2030:27-33&amp;version=NRSV">
Isaiah xxx, 27&ndash;33</a>. This passage is post-exilic indeed; but,
as Dr. Cheyne remarks (<i lang="la">Encycl. Biblica</i>, art. Molech,
col. 3,187): &ldquo;The tone of the allusion is rather that of a writer
remote from these atrocities than of a prophet in the midst of the
struggle against them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may then assume (1) that the custom of human sacrifice
disappeared among Jews centuries before our era; (2) that in the epoch
100 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> to 100 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>
every Jew, no matter where he lived, would view such rites and
reminiscences with horror. As a matter of fact, Philo dwells in
eloquent language on the horror and abomination of them as they were
still in his day sporadically celebrated, not among Jews, but among
pagans.</p>
<p>This being so, is it likely that any Jewish community would keep up
even the <i>simulacrum</i> of such rites? In Josephus and Philo, who
are our most important witnesses to the Judaism that just preceded or
was contemporary with early Christianity, there is no hint of such
rites as might constitute a memory and mimicry of human victims,
whether identified with a god or not. No serious pagan writer of that
age ever accused the Jews of keeping up such rites openly or in secret
among themselves. <span class="marginnote">Evidence of Apion accepted
by Mr. Robertson</span>Apion alone had a cock-and-bull story of how
Antiochus Epiphanes, when he took Jerusalem (c. 170 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>), found a Greek being fattened up by the Jews in the
<i>adytum</i> of the temple about to be slain and eaten in honour of
their god. Of course Mr. Robertson catches at this, and writes
(<i>Pagan Christs</i>, p. 161) that, &ldquo;in view of all the clues,
we cannot pronounce that story incredible.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>What
clues has he? The undoubted survival of ritual murder among the pagans
of Ph&oelig;nicia in that age is no clue, though it explains the
genesis of Apion&rsquo;s tale. And Mr. Robertson has one other treasure
trove&mdash;to wit, the obscure reading &ldquo;Jesus Barabbas&rdquo; in
certain MSS. of <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2027:17&amp;version=NRSV">
Matthew xxvii, 17</a>: &ldquo;Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that
I release unto you? (Jesus) Barabbas, or Jesus which is called
Christ?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The sacrificing of the mock king</span> It
has been plausibly suggested that the addition Jesus is due to a
scribe&rsquo;s reduplication, such as is common in Greek manuscripts,
of the last syllable of the word <i>humin</i> = unto you. The <i>in</i>
in uncials is a regular compendium for <i>Iesun</i> Jesus. In this way
the name Jesus may have crept in before Barabbas. The entire story of
Barabbas being released has an apocryphal air, for Pilate would not
have let off a rebel against the Roman rule to please the Jewish mob;
and the episode presupposes that it was the Sanhedrin which had
condemned Jesus to death, which is equally improbable. What is
probable, however, is that the Syrian soldiery to whom Pilate committed
Jesus for crucifixion were accustomed to the Sac&aelig;a festival of
Babylonian origin, and perhaps to the analogous Roman feast of the
Saturnalia. In such celebrations a mock king was chosen, and vested
with the costume, pomp, and privileges of kingship perhaps for as long
as three days. Then the mimicry of slaying him was gone through, and
sometimes the mock king was really put to death. Among Syrians the name
Barabbas may&mdash;it is a mere hypothesis&mdash;have been the
conventional appellation of the victim slain actually or in mock show
on such occasions; and the soldiers of Pilate may have treated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>him en Barabbas. Loisy suggests in his
<i>Commentary on the Synoptics</i> that this was the genesis of the
Barabbas story. That a pagan soldiery treated Jesus as a mock king,
when they dressed him in purple and set a crown of thorns on his head,
and, kneeling before him, cried &ldquo;Hail King of the Jews,&rdquo; is
quite possible; and serious scholars like Paul Wendland (<i>Hermes</i>,
Vol. XXXIII (1898), <span class="corr" id="xd25e1284" title=
"Source: foll.">fol.</span> 175) and Mr. W. R. Paton long ago discerned
the probability.</p>
<p>But it was one thing for Syrians and pagans to envisage the
crucifixion of Jesus under the aspect of a sacrifice to Molech, quite
another thing for Jews&mdash;whether as his enemies or as his
partisans&mdash;to do so; nor does the Gospel narrative suggest that
any Jews took part in the ceremony. Perhaps it was out of respect for
Jewish susceptibilities&mdash;and they were not likely to favour any
mockery of their Messianic aspirations&mdash;that Pilate caused Jesus
to be divested of the purple insignia of royalty and clad in his usual
garb before he was led out of the guardroom and through the streets of
Jerusalem on his way to Golgotha.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Evidence of Philo</span> We read in Philo
(<i>In Flaccum</i>, vi) of a very similar scene enacted in the streets
of Alexandria within ten years of the crucifixion. The young Agrippa,
elevated by Caligula to the throne of Jud&aelig;a, had landed in that
city, where feeling ran high between Jews and pagans. The latter, by
way of ridiculing the pretensions of the Jews to have a king of their
own, seized on a poor lunatic named Carabas who loitered night and day
naked about the streets, ran him as far as the Gymnasium, and there
stood him on a stool, so that all could see him, having first set a
mock diadem of byblus on his head and thrown <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>a rug
over his shoulders as a cloak of honour. In his hand they set a papyrus
stem by way of sceptre. Having thus arrayed him, as in a mime of the
theatre, with the insignia of mock royalty, the young men shouldering
sticks, as if they were a bodyguard, encircled him, while others
advanced, saluted his mock majesty, and pretended that he was their
judge and king sitting on his throne to direct the commonwealth.
Meanwhile a shout went up from the crowd around of <i>Marin</i>, which
in the Syrian language signified <i>Lord</i>.</p>
<p>This passage of Philo goes far to prove that the mockery of Jesus in
the Gospels was no more than a public ridiculing of the Jewish
expectations of a national leader or Messiah who should revive the
splendours of the old Davidic kingdom. In any case, the mockery is
conducted at Jerusalem by Pilate&rsquo;s soldiers (who were not Jews,
but a pagan garrison put there to overawe the Jews), at Alexandria by
such Greeks as Apion penned his calumnies to gratify. Mr.
Robertson&rsquo;s suggestion that the mock ceremony of the crucifixion
was performed by Jews or Christians is thus as absurd as it is
gratuitous. It was held in bitter despite of Jews and Christians, it
was a mockery and reviling of their most cherished hopes and ideals;
and yet he does not scruple to argue that it is &ldquo;a basis for the
whole gospel myth of the crucifixion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Evidence of the Khonds</span> Thus he is
left with the single calumny of Apion, which deserves about as much
credence as the similar tales circulated to-day against the Jews of
Bessarabia. That is the single item of evidence he has to prove what is
the very hinge of his theory&mdash;the supposition, namely, that the
Jews of Alexandria first, and afterwards <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>the Jews of Jerusalem,
celebrated in secret once a year ritual dramas representing the
ceremonial slaying of a Sun-God-Saviour Joshua, Son of the Father and
of the Virgin Miriam. It is a far cry to the horrible rites of the
Khonds of modern India; but Mr. Robertson, for whom wide differences of
age and place matter nothing when he is explaining Christian origins,
has discovered in them a key to the narrative of the crucifixion of
Jesus. He runs all round the world and collects rites of ritual murder
and cannibal sacraments of all ages, mixes them up, lumps them down
before us, and exclaims triumphantly, There is my &ldquo;psychological
clue&rdquo; to Christianity. The most superficial resemblances satisfy
him that an incident in Jerusalem early in our era is an essential
reproduction of a Khond ritual murder in honour of the goddess Tari.
Was there ever an author so hopelessly uncritical in his methods?</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Origin of the Gospels</span> The Gospels,
then, are a transcript of a mock murder of the Sun-god Joshua annually
performed in secret by the Jews of Jerusalem, for it had got there
before it was written down and discontinued. One asks oneself why, if
the Jews had tolerated so long a pagan survival among themselves, they
could not keep it up a little longer; and why the
&ldquo;Christists&rdquo; should be so anxious &ldquo;to break away from
paganism&rdquo; at exactly the same hour. Moreover, their breach with
paganism did not amount to much, since they kept the transcript of a
ritual drama framed on pagan lines and inspired throughout by pagan
ideas and myths; not only kept it, but elevated it into Holy Scripture.
At the same time they retained the Old Testament, which as Jews they
had immemorially <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>venerated as Holy Scripture; and for generations
they went on worshipping in the Jewish temple, kept the Jewish feasts
and fasts, and were zealous for circumcision. What a hotchpotch of a
sect!</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">How could a Sun-god slain annually be slain
by Pontius Pilate?</span> It occurs to me to ask Mr. Robertson a few
questions about this transcript. It was the annual mystery play reduced
to writing. The central event of the play was the annual death and
resurrection of a solar or vegetation god, whose attributes and career
were borrowed from the cults of Osiris, Adonis, Dionysus, and Co. All
these gods died once a year; and, I suppose, had you asked one of the
votaries when his god died, he would have answered, Every spring. Now
all the Gospels (in common with all Christian tradition) are unanimous
that Jesus only died once, about the time of the Passover, when Pilate
was Roman Governor of Jud&aelig;a, when Annas and Caiaphas were
high-priests and King Herod about. This surely is an extraordinary
record for a Sun-god who died once a year. And it was not in the
transcript only that all these fixities of date crept in, for Mr.
Robertson insists most vehemently that Pilate was an actor in the play.
&ldquo;Even the episode,&rdquo; he writes (<i>Pagan Christs</i>, p.
193), &ldquo;of the appeal of the priests and Pharisees to Pilate to
keep a guard on the tomb, though it might be a later interpolation,
could quite well have been a dramatic scene.&rdquo; In Mark and
Matthew, as containing &ldquo;the earlier version&rdquo; of the drama,
he detects everywhere a &ldquo;concrete theatricality.&rdquo; Thus he
commits himself to the astonishing paralogism that Pilate and Herod,
Annas and Caiaphas, and all the other personages of the closing
chapters of the Gospels, were features in an annually recurring passion
play of the Sun-god Joshua; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57"
href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>this play was not a novelty
introduced after the crucifixion, for there never was a real
crucifixion. On the contrary, it was a secret survival among paganized
Jews, a bit of Jewish pagan mummery that had been going on long ages
before the actors represented in it ever lived or were heard of. Such
is the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the thesis which peeps out
everywhere in Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s pages. And now we have found what
we were in search of&mdash;namely, the cultus and organization to
account for which a biography of Jesus had to be fabricated. The Life
of Apollonius, argues Mr. Robertson, cannot have been built up round a
hole, and as there was no organized cult of him (this is utterly
false), there must have been a real figure to fit the biography. In the
other case the organized and pre-existing cult was the nucleus around
which the Gospels grew up like fairy rings around a primal fungus. It
is not obvious why a cult should exclude a real founder, or, rather, a
real person, in honour of whom the cult was kept up. In the worship of
the Augustus or of the ancient Pharaoh, who impersonated and was
Osiris, we have both. Why not have both in the case of Jesus, to whose
real life and subsequent deification the Augusti and the Pharaohs offer
a remarkable parallel? But there never was any pre-Christian cult and
organization in Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s sense. It is a monstrous
outgrowth of his own imagination.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Historicity of Plato falls by the canons of
the mythicists</span> And as in the case of Apollonius, so in the case
of other ancients, he is careful not to apply those methods of
interpretation which he yet cannot pardon scholars for not applying to
Jesus. Let us take another example. Of the life of Plato we know next
to nothing. In the dialogues attributed to him his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>name is
only mentioned twice; and in both cases its mention could, if we adopt
Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s canons of interpretation, be with the utmost ease
explained away as an interpolation. The only life we have of him was
penned by Diogenes Laertius 600 years after he lived. The details of
his life supplied by Aristoxenus, a pupil of Aristotle, are obviously
false. The only notices preserved of him that can be claimed to be
contemporary are the few derived from his nephew Speusippus. Now what
had Speusippus to tell? Why, a story of the birth of Plato which, as
Mr. Robertson (p. 293) writes, scarcely differs from the story of
<a class="biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%201:18-25&amp;version=NRSV">
Matthew i, 18&ndash;25</a>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the special machinery of the Joseph and Mary
myth&mdash;the warning in a dream and the abstention of the
husband&mdash;we have a simple duplication of the relations of the
father and mother of Plato, the former being warned in a dream by
Apollo, so that the child was virgin-born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, just as the Christians chose a &ldquo;solar date&rdquo; for
the birthday of Jesus, so the Platonists, according to Mr. Robertson,
p. 308, &ldquo;placed the master&rsquo;s birthday on that of
Apollo&mdash;that is, either at Christmas or at the vernal
equinox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now in the case of Jesus such legends and events as the above
suffice to convince Mr. Robertson that the history of Jesus as told in
the Gospels is a mere survival of &ldquo;ancient solar or other worship
of a babe Joshua, son of Miriam,&rdquo; of which ancient worship
nothing is known except that it looms large in the imagination of
himself, of Dr. Drews, and of Professor W. B. Smith. On the other hand,
we do know that a cult of Apollo existed, and that it is no fiction of
these modern writers. Surely, then, it is time we <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>changed
our opinion about the historicity of Plato. Is it not as clear as
daylight that he was the survival of a pre-Platonic Apollo myth? We
know the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> assigned to Apollo of revealer of
philosophic truth. Well, here were the dialogues and letters of Plato,
calling for an explanation of their origin; a sect of Platonists who
cherished these writings and kept the feast of their master on a solar
date. On all the principles of the new mythico-symbolic system Plato,
as a man, had no right to exist. &ldquo;Without Jesus,&rdquo; writes
Drews, &ldquo;the rise of Christianity can be quite well
understood.&rdquo; Yes, and, by the same logic, no less the rise of
Platonism without Plato, or of the cult of Apollonius without
Apollonius. What is sauce for the goose is surely sauce for the gander.
With a mere change of names we could write of Plato what on p. 282 Mr.
Robertson writes of Jesus. Let us do it: &ldquo;The gospel Jesus
(<i>read</i> dialogist Plato) is as enigmatic from a humanist as from a
supernaturalist point of view. Miraculously born, to the knowledge of
many (<i>read</i> of his nephew Speusippus, of Clearchus whose
testimony &lsquo;belongs to Plato&rsquo;s generation,&rsquo; of
Anaxilides the historian and others), he reappears as a natural man
even in the opinion of his parents (<i>read</i> of nephew Speusippus
and the rest); the myth will not cohere. Rationally considered, he
(Plato) is an unintelligible portent; a Galilean (<i>read</i> Athenian)
of the common people, critically untraceable till his full manhood,
when he suddenly appears as a cult-founder.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Virgin Birth no part of the earliest
Gospel tradition</span> Why does Mr. Robertson so incessantly labour
the point that the belief in the supernatural birth of Jesus came first
in time, and was anterior to the belief that he was born a man of men?
This he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>implies in the words just cited:
&ldquo;Miraculously born, to the knowledge of many, he reappears as a
natural man.&rdquo; A story almost identical with that of the Massacre
of the Innocents by Herod was, Mr. Robertson tells us (p. 184), told of
the Emperor Augustus <i>in his lifetime</i>, and appears in Suetonius
&ldquo;as accepted history.&rdquo; And elsewhere (p. 395) he writes:
&ldquo;It was after these precedents (<i>i.e.</i>, of Antiochus and
Ptolemy) that Augustus, besides having himself given out, like
Alexander, as begotten of a God, caused himself to be proclaimed in the
East &hellip; as being born under Providence a Saviour and a God and
the beginning of an Evangel of peace to mankind.&rdquo; Like
Plato&rsquo;s story, then, so the official and contemporary legends of
Augustus closely resembled the later ones of Jesus. Yet Mr. Robertson
complacently accepts the historicity of Plato and Augustus, merely
brushing aside the miraculous stories and supernatural
<i>r&ocirc;le</i>. Nowhere in his works does he manifest the faintest
desire to apply in the domain of profane history the canons which he so
rigidly enforces in ecclesiastical.</p>
<p>Yet there are passages in Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s works where he
seems, to use his own phrase, to &ldquo;glimpse&rdquo; the truth. Thus,
on p. 124 of <i>Christianity and Mythology</i> he writes: &ldquo;Jesus
is said to be born of a Virgin; but not in the original version of the
first gospel; and not in the second; and not in the fourth; and not in
any writing or by any mouth known to or credited by the writers of the
Pauline Epistles. Here we see how a myth may be superimposed on a
cult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does not this mean that a <i>cult</i> of Jesus already existed
before this myth was added, and that the myth is absent in the earliest
documents of the cult? Again, on p. 274, he writes that &ldquo;the
Christian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>Virgin-myth and Virgin-and-child worship are
certainly of pre-Christian origin, and <i>of comparatively late
Christian acceptance</i>.&rdquo; Yet, when I drew attention in the
<i>Literary Guide</i> of December 1, 1912, to the inconsistency with
this passage of the later one above cited, which asserts that,
&ldquo;Miraculously born, to the knowledge of many, he reappears as a
natural man,&rdquo; he replied (January 1, 1913) that &ldquo;a reader
of ordinary candour would understand that &lsquo;acceptance&rsquo;
applied to the official action of the Church.&rdquo; It appears,
therefore, that in the cryptic secret society of the Joshua
Sun-God-Saviour, which held its s&eacute;ances at Jerusalem at the
beginning of our era, there was an official circle which lagged behind
the unofficial multitude. The latter knew from the first that their
solar myth was miraculously born; but the official and controlling
inner circle ignored the miracle until late in the development of the
cult, and then at last issued a number of documents from which it was
excluded. One wonders why. Why trouble to utter these documents in
which Jesus &ldquo;reappears as a natural man,&rdquo; long after the
sect as a whole were committed to the miraculous birth? What is the
meaning of these wheels within wheels, that hardly hunt together? We
await an explanation. Meanwhile let us probe the new mythico-symbolism
a little further.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The cleansing of the temple</span> Why did
the solar God Joshua-Jesus scourge the money-changers out of the
temple? Answer: Because it is told of Apollonius of Tyana, &ldquo;that
he expelled from the cities of the left bank of the Hellespont some
sorcerers who were extorting money for a great propitiatory sacrifice
to prevent earthquakes.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>The connection is beautifully obvious like the rest of our
author&rsquo;s <i>rapprochements</i>; but we must accept it, or we
shall lay ourselves open to the reproach of &ldquo;psychological
resistance to evidence.&rdquo; Nor must we ask how the memoirs of
Damis, that lay in a corner till Philostratus got hold of them in the
year 215, enjoyed so much vogue among the &ldquo;Christists&rdquo; of
Jerusalem long years before they can conceivably have been written.</p>
<p>Why on the occasion in question did Jesus make a scourge of cords
with which to drive the sheep and oxen out of the Temple? Answer:
&ldquo;Because in the Assyrian and Egyptian systems a scourge-bearing
god is a very common figure on the monuments &hellip; it is specially
associated with Osiris, the Saviour, Judge, and Avenger. A figure of
Osiris, reverenced as &lsquo;Chrestos&rsquo; the benign God, would
suffice to set up among Christists as erewhile among pagans the demand
for an explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we get a precious insight into the why and wherefore of the
Gospels. They were intended by the &ldquo;Christists&rdquo; to explain
the meaning of Osiris statues. Why could they not have asked one of the
priests of Osiris, who as a rule might be found in the neighbourhood of
his statues, what the emblem meant? And, after all, were statues of
Osiris so plentiful in Jerusalem, where the sight even of a Roman eagle
aroused a riot?</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Janus-Peter the <i>bifrons</i></span> Who
was Peter? Answer: An understudy of Mithras, who in the monuments bears
two keys; or of Janus, who bears the keys and the rod, and as opener of
the year (hence the name January) stands at the head of the twelve
months.</p>
<p>Why did Peter deny Jesus? Answer: Because <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>Janus
was called <i>bifrons</i>. The epithet puzzled the
&ldquo;Christists&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jesuists&rdquo; of Jerusalem, who,
instead of asking the first Roman soldier they met what it meant,
proceeded to render the word <i>bifrons</i> in the sense of
&ldquo;double-faced,&rdquo; quite a proper epithet they thought for
Peter, who thenceforth had to be held guilty of an act of
double-dealing. For we must not forget that it was the epithet which
suggested to the Christists the invention of the story, and not the
story that of the epithet. But even Mr. Robertson is not quite sure of
this; and it does not matter, where there is such a wealth of
alternatives. For Peter is also an understudy of &ldquo;the fickle
Proteus.&rdquo; Janus&rsquo;s double head was anyhow common on coins,
and with that highly relevant observation he essays to protect his
theories of Janus-Peter from any possible criticisms. Indeed, we are
forbidden to call in question the above conclusions. They are quite
certain, because the &ldquo;Christists&rdquo; were intellectually
&ldquo;about the business of forming myths in explanation of old ritual
and old statuary&rdquo; (p. 350). Wonderful people these early
&ldquo;Christists,&rdquo; who, although they were, as Mr. Robertson
informs us (p. 348), &ldquo;apostles of a Judaic cult preaching
circumcision,&rdquo; and therefore by instinct inimical to all plastic
art, nevertheless rivalled the modern arch&aelig;ologist in their
desire to explain <i>old statuary</i>. They seem to have been the
prototypes of the Jews of Wardour Street. No less wonderful were they
as philologists, in that, being Hebrews and presumably speaking
Aramaic, they took such a healthy interest in the meaning of Latin
words, and discovered in <i>bifrons</i> a sense which it never bore in
any Latin author who ever used it! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64"
href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The keys of Peter</span> It appears to have
escaped the notice of Professor Franz Cumont that Mithras carries in
his monuments two keys. The two keys were an attribute of the Mithraic
Kronos, in old Persian Zervan, whom relatively late the Latins confused
with Janus, who also had two heads and carried keys. That late
Christian images of Peter were imitated from statues of these gods no
one need doubt, and Fr. Cumont (<i lang="fr">Monuments de Mithras</i>,
i, 85) does not reject such an idea. It is quite another thing to
assume dogmatically that the text <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2016:19&amp;version=NRSV">
Matthew xvi, 19</a> was suggested by a statue of Janus or of Zervan. To
explain it you need not leave Jewish ground, but merely glance at

Jew, up to <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 70, would understand such
imagery, for he saw every evening the temple keys ceremoniously taken
from a hole under the temple floor, where they were kept under a slab
of stone. The Levite watcher locked up the temple and replaced the keys
under the slab, upon which he then laid his bed for the night. In
connection with the magic power of binding and loosing the keys had, of
course, a further and magical significance, not in Jud&aelig;a alone,
but all over the world, and the Evangelists did not need to examine
statues of Janus or Zervan in order to come by this bit of everyday
symbolism.</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;No connection of Janus-Peter of the Gospels <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>with
Peter of the Pauline Epistles! The one was a mythical companion of the
Sun-god, the other a man of flesh and blood, according to Mr.
Robertson.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Joseph and his ass</span> Who was Joseph?
Answer: Forasmuch as &ldquo;the Christian system is a patchwork of a
hundred suggestions drawn from pagan art and ritual usage&rdquo; (p.
305), and &ldquo;Christism was only neo-Paganism grafted on
Judaism&rdquo; (p. 338), Joseph must be regarded as &ldquo;a partial
revival of the ancient adoration of the God Joseph as well as of that
of the God Daoud&rdquo; (p. 303). He was also, seeing that he took Mary
and her child on an ass into Egypt, a reminiscence; or, shall we not
say, an explanation of &ldquo;the feeble old man leading an ass in the
sacred procession of Isis, as described by Apuleius in his
<i>Metamorphoses</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no mention of Joseph&rsquo;s ass in the Gospels, but that
does not matter. Dr. Drews is better informed, and would have us
recognize in Joseph an understudy of Kinyras, the father of Adonis, who
&ldquo;is said to have been some kind of artisan, a smith, or
carpenter. That is to say, he is supposed to have invented the
hammer,&rdquo; etc. Might I suggest the addition of the god Thor to the
collection of gospel aliases? The gods Joseph and Daoud are purely
modern fictions; no ancient Jew ever heard of either.</p>
<p>Why was Jesus crucified?</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Crucifixion</span> &ldquo;The story of
the Crucifixion <i>may</i> rest on the remote datum of an actual
crucifixion of Jesus Ben Pandira, the possible Jesus of Paul, dead long
before, and represented by no preserved biography or teachings
whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Christists were clearly pastmasters in the art of explaining
<i lang="la">ignotum per ignotius</i>. For on the next page we learn
that it is not known whether this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66"
href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>worthy &ldquo;ever lived or was
crucified.&rdquo; In <i>Pagan Christs</i> he is acknowledged to be a
&ldquo;mere name.&rdquo; However this be, &ldquo;it was the mythic
significance of crucifixion that made the early fortune of the cult,
with the aid of the mythic significance of the name Jeschu = Joshua,
the ancient Sun-god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meaning of this oracular pronouncement is too profound for me to
attempt to fathom it. Let us pass on to another point in the new
elucidation of the Gospels.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">W. B. Smith on exorcisms of devils</span>
What were the exorcisms of evil spirits ascribed to the ancient Sun-god
Joshua, under his <i>alias</i> of Jesus of Nazareth?</p>
<p>In his <i>Pagan Christs</i>, as in his <i>Christianity and
Mythology</i>, Mr. Robertson unkindly leaves us in the lurch about this
matter, although we would dearly like to know what were the particular
arch&aelig;ological researches of the &ldquo;Christists&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Jesuists&rdquo; that led them to coin these myths of exorcisms
performed, and of devils cast out of the mad or sick by their solar
myth. Nor does Dr. Drews help us much. Never mind. Professor W. B.
Smith nobly stands in the breach, so we will let him take up the
parable; the more so because, in handling this problem, he may be said
to have excelled himself. On p. 57, then, of <i lang="la">Ecce
Deus</i>, he premises, in approaching this delicate topic, that
&ldquo;in the activity of the Jesus and the apostles, as delineated in
the Gospels, the one all-important moment is the <i>casting-out of
demons</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this all will agree; but what follows is barely consonant with
the thesis of his friends. He cites in effect <a class=
"biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%203:14-15&amp;version=NRSV">
Mark iii, 14, 15</a>, and the parallel passages in which Jesus is
related to have sent forth the twelve disciples to preach and to have
authority to cast <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67"
name="pb67">67</a>]</span>out the demons. Now, according to the
mythico-symbolical theory, the career of Jesus and his disciples lay
not on earth, but in that happy region where mythological personages
live and move and have their being. As Dr. Drews says (<i>The Christ
Myth</i>, p. 117): &ldquo;In reality the whole of the family and home
life of the Messiah, Jesus, took place in heaven among the
gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, Dr. W. B. Smith finds it &ldquo;amazing that anyone
should hesitate an instant over the sense&rdquo; of the demonological
episodes in the Gospels, and he continues: &ldquo;When we recall the
fact that the early Christians uniformly understood the heathen gods to
be demons, and uniformly represented the mission of Jesus to be the
overthrow of these demon gods, it seems as clear as the sun at noon
that this fall of Satan from heaven<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1531src"
href="#xd25e1531" name="xd25e1531src">16</a> can be nothing less (and
how could it possibly be anything more?) than the headlong ruin of
polytheism&mdash;the complete triumph of the One Eternal God. It seems
superfluous to insist on anything so palpable&#8202;&hellip;. Can any
rational man for a moment believe that the Saviour sent forth his
apostles and disciples with such awful solemnity to heal the few
lunatics that languished in Galilee? Is that the way the sublimist of
teachers would found the new and true religion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the last sentence our author nods and lapses into the historical
mood; for how can one talk of a mythical Joshua being a teacher and
founding a new religion&mdash;of his sending forth the apostles and
disciples? These things are done on earth, and not up in heaven
&ldquo;among the gods,&rdquo; as Drews says. It <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>is,
perhaps, impertinent, for the rest, to criticize so exalted an argument
as Professor Smith&rsquo;s; yet the question suggests itself, why, if
the real object of the mystic sectaries who worshipped in secret the
&ldquo;Proto-Christian God, the Jesus,&rdquo; was to acquaint the
faithful with the triumph of the heavenly Jesus over the demon-gods of
paganism&mdash;why, in that case, did they wrap it up in purely
demonological language? All around them exorcists, Jewish and pagan,
were driving out demons of madness and disease at every street
corner&mdash;dumb devils, rheumatic devils, blind devils, devils of
every sort and kind. Was it entirely appropriate for these mystic
devotees to encourage the use of demonological terminology, when they
meant something quite else? &ldquo;These early propagandists,&rdquo; he
tells us, p. 143, &ldquo;were great men, were very great men; they
conceived noble and beautiful and attractive ideas, which they defended
with curious learning and logic, and recommended with captivating
rhetoric and persuasive oratory and consuming zeal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely it was within the competence of such egregious teachers to
say without disguise what they really meant, instead of beating about
the bush and penning stories which so nearly reproduced the grovelling
superstitions of the common herd around them? They might at least have
issued a Delphin edition of their gospels, with a paraphrase in the
margin to explain the text and to save the faithful from taking these
stories literally&mdash;for so they took them as far back as we can
trace the documents; and, what is more, in all those derivative
churches all over the world which continued the inner life of Professor
Smith&rsquo;s mystic sectaries, we hear from the earliest age of the
appointing of vulgar exorcists, whose duty <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>was to
expel from the faithful the demons of madness and of all forms of
sickness.</p>
<p>But worse than this. We know from Mr. Robertson and Dr. Drews that
the same Proto-Christian Joshua-God, who was waging war in heaven on
the pagan gods and goddesses, was himself a composite myth made up of
memories of Krishna, &AElig;sculapius, Osiris, Apollo, Dionysus,
Apollonius, and a hundred other fiends. Mr. Robertson attests this, p.
305, in these words: &ldquo;As we have seen and shall see throughout
this investigation, the Christian system is a patchwork of a hundred
suggestions drawn from pagan art and ritual usage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is it quite appropriate that the pre-Christian Jesus or Joshua
should turn and rend his pagan congeners in the manner described by
Professor W. B. Smith? His mythical antecedents, as ascertained by Mr.
Robertson and Dr. Drews, are grotesquely incompatible with the
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> of monotheistic founder assigned him by Professor W.
B. Smith. Are we to suppose that the learned and eloquent propagandists
of his cult were aware of this incompatibility, and for that reason
chose to veil their monotheistic propaganda in the decent obscurity of
everyday demonological language?</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mary and her homonyms</span> Who was Mary,
the mother of Jesus?</p>
<p>Let Dr. Drews speak first:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Now if Joseph, as we have already seen, was originally
a god, Mary, the mother of Jesus, was a goddess. Under the name of
Maya, she is the mother of Agni&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the principle of
motherhood and creation simply, as which she is in the Rigveda at one
time represented by the fire-producing wood, the soft pith, in which
the fire-stick was whirled; at another as the earth, with which the sky
has mated. She appears under the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70"
href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>same name as the mother of
Buddha as well as of the Greek Hermes. She is identical with Maira
(Maera) as, according to Pausanias, viii, 12, 48, the pleiad Maia, wife
of Hephaistos was called. She appears among the Persians as the
&ldquo;virgin&rdquo; mother of Mithras. As Myrrha she is the mother of
the Syrian Adonis; as Semiramis, mother of the Babylonian Ninus
(Marduk). In the Arabic legend she appears under the name of Mirzam as
mother of the mythical saviour Joshua; while the Old Testament gives
this name to the virgin sister of that Joshua who was so closely
related to Moses; and, according to Eusebius, Merris was the name of
the Egyptian princess who found Moses in a basket and became his foster
mother.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above <i lang="la">purpureus pannus</i> is borrowed by Dr. Drews
in the second edition of his work from Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s book, p.
297. Here is the original:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is not possible from the existing data to connect
historically such a cult with its congeners; but the mere analogy of
names and epithets goes far. The mother of Adonis, the slain
&ldquo;Lord&rdquo; of the great Syrian cult, is Myrrha; and Myrrha in
one of her myths is the weeping tree from which the babe Adonis is
born. Again, Hermes, the Greek <i>Logos</i>, has for mother Maia, whose
name has further connections with Mary. In one myth Maia is the
daughter of Atlas, thus doubling with Maira, who has the same father,
and who, having &ldquo;died a virgin,&rdquo; was seen by Odysseus in
Hades. Mythologically, Maira is identified with the Dog-Star, which is
the star of Isis. Yet again, the name appears in the East as Maya, the
virgin-mother of Buddha; and it is remarkable that, according to a
Jewish legend, the name of the Egyptian princess who found the babe
Moses was Merris. The plot is still further thickened by the fact that,
as we learn from the monuments, one of the daughters of Ramses II was
named Meri. And as Meri meant &ldquo;beloved,&rdquo; and the name was
at times given to men, besides being used in the phrase &ldquo;beloved
of the gods,&rdquo; the field of mythic speculation is wide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>And we feel that it is, indeed, wide, when, on p. 301, the three
Marias mentioned by Mark are equated with the three <i>Moirai</i> or
Fates!</p>
<p>In another passage we meet afresh with one of these equations, p.
306. It runs thus: &ldquo;On the hypothesis that the mythical Joshua,
son of Miriam, was an early Hebrew deity, it may be that one form of
the Tammuz cult in pre-Christian times was a worship of a mother and
child&mdash;Mary and Adonis; that, in short, Maria = Myrrha, and that
Jesus was a name of Adonis.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Pre-philological arguments</span> From such
deliverances we gather that in Mr. Robertson and his disciples we have
survivals of a stage of culture which may be called prephilological. A
hundred years ago or more the most superficial resemblance of sound was
held to be enough of a ground for connecting words and names together,
and Oxford divines were busy deriving all other tongues from the Hebrew
spoken in the Garden of Eden by Adam and Eve. Mr. Robertson sets
himself (p. 139) to ridicule these old-fashioned writers, and regales
us with not a few examples of that over-facile identification of cult
names that have no real mutual affinity which was then in vogue. Thus
<i>Krishna</i> was held to be a corruption of <i>Christ</i> by certain
oriental missionaries, just as, inversely, within my memory, certain
English Rationalists argued the name <i>Christ</i> to be a disguise of
<i>Krishna</i>. So <i>Brahma</i> was identified with <i>Abraham</i>,
and Napoleon with the <i>Apollyon</i> of Revelation. One had hoped that
this phase of culture was past and done with; but Messrs. Robertson and
Drews revive it in their books, and seem anxious to perpetuate it. As
with names, so with myths. On their every page we encounter&mdash;to
use the apt phrase <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72"

<p><span class="marginnote">Right use of comparative method</span> The
one condition of advancing knowledge and clearing men&rsquo;s minds of
superstition and cant by application of the comparative method in
religion, is that we should apply it, as did Robertson Smith and his
great predecessor, Dr. John Spencer,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1628src" href="#xd25e1628" name="xd25e1628src">18</a> cautiously,
and in a spirit of scientific scholarship. It does not do to argue from
superficial resemblances of sound that Maria is the same name as the
Greek <i>Moira</i>, or that the name Maia has &ldquo;connections with
Mary&rdquo;; or, again, that &ldquo;the name (<i>Maria</i>) appears in
the East as Maya.&rdquo; The least acquaintance with Hebrew would have
satisfied Mr. Robertson that the original form of the name he thus
conjures with is not Maria, but <i>Miriam</i>, which does not lend
itself to his hardy equations. I suspect he is carried away by the
<i lang="la">parti pris</i> which leaks out in the following passage of
his henchman and imitator, Dr. Drews<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1647src" href="#xd25e1647" name="xd25e1647src">19</a>: &ldquo;The
romantic cult of Jesus must be combated at all costs&#8202;&hellip;.
This cannot be done more effectually than by taking its basis in the
theory of the historical Jesus from beneath its feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If &ldquo;at all costs&rdquo; means at the cost of common sense and
scholarship, I cannot agree. I am not disposed, at the invitation of
any self-constituted high priest of Rationalism, to derive old Hebrew
names from Egyptian, Greek, and Buddhist appellations that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>happen
to show an initial and one or two other letters in common. I will not
believe that a &ldquo;Christist&rdquo; of Alexandria or Jerusalem, in
the streets of which the Latin language was seldom or never heard, took
the epithet <i>bifrons</i> in a wrong sense, and straightway invented
the story of a Peter who had denied Jesus. I cannot admit that the
cults of Osiris, Dionysus, Apollo, or any other ancient Sun-god, are
echoed in a single incident narrated in the primitive evangelical
tradition that lies before us in Mark and the non-Marcan document used
by the authors of the first and third Gospels; I do not believe that
any really educated man or woman would for a moment entertain any of
the equations propounded by Mr. Robertson, and of which I have given a
few select examples.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Marett on method</span> Mr. Marett, in his
essay entitled <i>The Birth of Humility</i>, by way of criticizing
certain modern abuses of the comparative method in the field of the
investigation of the origin of moral ideas and religious beliefs, has
justly remarked that &ldquo;No isolated fragment of custom or belief
can be worth much for the purposes of comparative science. In order to
be understood, it must first be viewed in the light of the whole
culture, the whole corporate soul-life, of the particular ethnic group
concerned. Hence the new way is to emphasize concrete differences,
whereas the old way was to amass resemblances heedlessly abstracted
from their social context. Which way is the better is a question that
well-nigh answers itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apply the above rule to nascent Christianity. In the Synoptic
Gospels Jesus ever speaks as a Jew to Jews. Jewish monotheism is
presupposed by the authors of them to have been no less the heritage of
Jesus than of his audiences. The rare exceptions are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>carefully noticed by them. This consideration has
so impressed Professor W. B. Smith that he urges the thesis that the
Christian religion originated as a monotheist propaganda. That is no
doubt an exaggeration, for it was at first a Messianic movement or
impulse among Jews, and therefore did not need to set the claims of
monotheism in the foreground, and, accordingly, in the Synoptic Gospels
they are nowhere urged. In spite of this exaggeration, however, Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s book occupies a higher plane than the works of Dr. Drews
and Mr. Robertson, insofar as he shows some slight insight into the
original nature of the religion, whereas they show none at all. They
merely, in Mr. Marett&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;amass resemblances [would
they were even such!] heedlessly abstracted from their context,&rdquo;
and resolve a cult which, as it appears on the stage of history, is
Jewish to its core, of which the Holy Scripture was no other than the
Law and the Prophets, and of which the earliest documents, as Mr.
Selwyn has shown, are saturated with the Jewish Septuagint&mdash;they
try to resolve this cult into a tagrag and bobtail of Greek and Roman
paganism, of Buddhism, of Brahmanism, of Mithraism (hardly yet born),
of Egyptian, African, Assyrian, old Persian,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1670src" href="#xd25e1670" name="xd25e1670src">20</a> and any
other religions with which these writers have a second-hand and
superficial acquaintance. Never once do they pause and ask themselves
the simple questions: firstly, how the early Christians came to be
imbued with so intimate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href=
"#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>a knowledge of idolatrous cults far
and near, new and old; secondly, why they set so much store by them as
the mythico-symbolic hypothesis presupposes that they did; and,
thirdly, why, if they valued them so much, they were at pains to
translate them into the utterly different and antagonistic form which
they wear in the Gospels. In a word, why should such connoisseurs of
paganism have disguised themselves as monotheistic and messianic Jews?
Mr. Robertson tries to save his hypothesis by injecting a little dose
of Judaism into his &ldquo;Christists&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Jesuists&rdquo;; but anyone who has read Philo or Josephus or
the Bible, not to mention the Apostolic Fathers and Justin Martyr, will
see at a glance that there is no room in history for such a hybrid.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Methods of Robertson and Lorinser</span>
That Mr. Robertson should put his name to such works as Dr. Drews
imitates and singles out for special praise is the more remarkable,
because, in urging the independence of certain Hindoo cults against
Christian missionaries who want to see in them mere reflections of
Christianity, he shows himself both critical and wide-minded. These
characteristics he displays in his refutation of the opinion of a
certain Dr. Lorinser that the dialogue between Krishna and the warrior
Arjuna, known as the Bhagavat G&icirc;t&acirc; and embodied in the old
Hindoo Epic of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata, &ldquo;is a patchwork of
Christian teaching.&rdquo; Dr. Lorinser had adduced a chain of passages
from this document which to his mind are echoes of the New Testament.
Though many of these exhibit a striking conformity with aphorisms of
the Gospels, we are nevertheless constrained to agree with Mr.
Robertson&rsquo;s criticism, which is as follows (p. 262):&mdash;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The first comment that must occur to every instructed
reader on perusing these and the other &ldquo;parallels&rdquo; advanced
by Dr. Lorinser is, that on the one hand the parallels are very
frequently such as could be made by the dozen between bodies of
literature which have unquestionably never been brought in contact, so
strained and far-fetched are they; and that, on the other hand, they
are discounted by quite as striking parallels between New Testament
texts and pre-Christian pagan writings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Robertson then adduces a number of striking parallelisms between
the New Testament and old Greek and Roman writers, and continues thus:
&ldquo;Such parallels as these, I repeat, could be multiplied to any
extent from the Greek and Latin classics alone&#8202;&hellip;. But is
it worth while to heap up the disproof of a thesis so manifestly
idle?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Dionysus and Jesus</span> It occurs to ask
whether it was not worth the while of Mr. Robertson to inquire whether
the Evangelist could &ldquo;unquestionably have been brought in
contact&rdquo; with the Dionysiac group of myths before he assumed so
dogmatically, against students of such weight as Professor Percy
Gardner and Dr. Estlin Carpenter, that the myth of Bacchus meeting with
a couple of asses on his way to Dodona was the
&ldquo;Christist&rsquo;s&rdquo; model for the story of Jesus riding
into Jerusalem on an ass? Might he not have reflected that then, as
now, there was no other way of entering Jerusalem unless you went on
foot? And what has Jerusalem to do with Dodona? What has
Bacchus&rsquo;s choice of one ass to ride on in common with
Matthew&rsquo;s literary deformation, according to which Jesus rode on
two asses at once? Lastly, what had Bacchus to do with Jesus? Has the
Latin wine-god a single trait in common with the Christian founder? Is
it not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>rather the case that any conscious or even
unconscious assimilation of Bacchus myths conflicts with what Mr.
Marett would call &ldquo;the whole culture, the whole corporate
soul-life&rdquo; of the early Christian community, as the surviving
documents picture it, and other evidence we have not? Yet Mr. Robertson
deduces from such paltry &ldquo;parallels&rdquo; as the above the
conclusion that Jesus, on whose real personality a score of early and
independent literary sources converge, never existed at all, and that
he was a &ldquo;composite myth.&rdquo; There is no other example of an
eclectic myth arbitrarily composed by connoisseurs out of a religious
art and story not their own; still less of such a myth being humanized
and accepted by the next generation as a Jewish Messiah.</p>
<p>In the same context (p. 264) Mr. Robertson remarks sensibly enough
that &ldquo;No great research or reflection is needed to make it clear
that certain commonplaces of ethics as well as of theology are equally
inevitable conclusions in all religious systems that rise above
savagery. Four hundred years before Jesus, Plato declared that it was
very difficult for the rich to be good; does anyone believe that any
thoughtful Jew needed Plato&rsquo;s help to reach the same
notion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would ask, does anyone believe that a thoughtful Jew needed the
stimulus of a statuette of Osiris in order that he should record, or,
maybe, invent, the story of Jesus clearing the money-changers out of
the temple with a scourge? Even admitting&mdash;what I am as little as
anyone inclined to admit&mdash;that the Peter of the early Gospels is,
as regards his personality and his actions, a fable, a mere invention
of a Jewish storyteller, need we suppose that the storyteller in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>question depended for his inspiration on Janus?
You might as well suppose that the authors of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>
founded their stories on the myths of Greek and Roman gods. Again, the
Jews were traditionally distributed into twelve tribes or clans. Let us
grant only for argument&rsquo;s sake that the life of Jesus the Messiah
as narrated in the first three Gospels is a romance, we yet must ask,
Which is more probable, that the author of the romance assigned twelve
apostles to Jesus because there were twelve tribes to whom the message
of the impending Kingdom of God had to be carried, or because there are
twelve signs in the Zodiac? He agrees (p. 347) that Luke&rsquo;s story
of the choice of the seventy disciples &ldquo;visibly connects with the
Jewish idea that there were seventy nations in the world.&rdquo; Why,
then, reject the view that Jesus chose twelve apostles because there
were twelve tribes? Not at all. Having decided that Jesus was the
Sun-God-Saviour Joshua, a pure figment of his brain, Mr. Robertson is
ready to violate the canons of evidence he appeals to on p. 347, and
will have it that in the Gospels the apostles are Zodiacal signs, and
that their leader is Janus, the opener of the year. &ldquo;The Zodiacal
sign gives the clue&rdquo; (p. 339), in his opinion, to this as to much
else.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Dr. Lorinser</span> Let us return to the
case of Dr. Lorinser. &ldquo;We are asked to believe that Brahmans
expounding a highly-developed Pantheism went assiduously to the
(unattainable) New Testament for the wording of a number of their
propositions, pantheistic and other, while assimilating absolutely
nothing of distinctively Christian doctrine&#8202;&hellip;. Such a
position is possible only to a mesmerized believer.&rdquo; Surely one
may exclaim of Mr. Robertson, <i lang="la">De te fabula narratur</i>,
and rewrite <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>the above as follows: &ldquo;We are asked to
believe that &lsquo;Christists,&rsquo; who were so far Jewish as to
practise circumcision, to use the Hebrew Scriptures, to live in
Jerusalem under the presidency and patronage of the Jewish High-priest,
to foster and propagate Jewish monotheism, went assiduously to the
(unattainable) rites, statuary, art, and beliefs of pagan India, Egypt,
Ancient Babylon, Persia, etc., for all &lsquo;the narrative
myths&rsquo; (p. 263) of the story in which they narrated the history
of their putative founder Jesus, the Jewish Messiah, while assimilating
absolutely nothing of distinctively pagan doctrine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lorinser, for urging a thesis infinitely less absurd, is
denounced as &ldquo;a mesmerized believer&rdquo;; and on the next page
Dr. Weber, who agrees with him, is rebuked for his &ldquo;judicial
blindness.&rdquo; Yet in the same context we are told that &ldquo;a
crude and <i>na&iuml;f</i> system, like the Christism of the second
gospel and the earlier form of the first, borrows inevitably from the
more highly evolved systems with which it comes socially in contact,
absorbing myth and mystery and dogma till it becomes as sophisticated
as they.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is quite true, as Gibbon observed, that the <i>na&iuml;f</i>
figure of Jesus, as presented in the Synoptic Gospels, was soon
overlaid with that of the <i>logos</i>, and all sorts of Christological
cobwebs were within a few generations spun around his head to the
effacement both of the teacher and of what he taught. But in the
earliest body of the evangelical tradition, as we can construct it from
the first three Gospels, there is little or nothing that is not
essentially Jewish and racy of the soil of Jud&aelig;a. The borrowings
of Christianity from pagan neighbours began with the flocking into the
new Messianic society of Gentile converts. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>earlier
borrowings with which Messrs. Robertson and Drews fill their volumes
are one and all &ldquo;resemblances heedlessly abstracted from their
context,&rdquo; and are as far-fetched and as fanciful as the dreams of
the adherents of the Banner of Israel, or as the cypher of the
<span class="corr" id="xd25e1729" title=

Robertson is prone to make merry. &ldquo;Is it,&rdquo; to use his own

manifestly idle?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href=

John xix, 23, 24</a>, we have an exact analogy with this passage of
Matthew. In <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=

Psalm xxii, <span class="corr" id="xd25e757" title=
"Source: 19">18</span></a>, we read: &ldquo;They parted my garments
among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.&rdquo; Here one and
the same incident is contemplated in both halves of the verse, and it
is but a single garment that is divided. Now see what John makes out of
this verse, regarded as a prophecy of Jesus. He pretends that the
soldiers took Jesus&rsquo;s garments, and made four parts, to every
soldier a part, so fulfilling the words: &ldquo;They parted my garments
among them.&rdquo; Next they took the coat without seam, and said to
one another: &ldquo;Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it
shall be.&rdquo; The parallel with Matthew is exact. In each case what
is mere rhetorical reduplication is interpreted of two distinct
objects, and on this misinterpretation is based a fulfilment of
prophecy, and out of it generated a new form of a story or a fresh
story altogether. In defiance of the opinion of competent Hebraists,
Mr. Robertson writes (p. 338) that &ldquo;there is no other instance of
such a peculiar tautology in the Old Testament.&rdquo; On the contrary,

have given Professor Smith a better tip. Philo composed a glossary of
Biblical and other names with their meanings, which, though lost in
Greek, survives in an old Armenian version. In this Essene is equated
with &ldquo;silence.&rdquo; What a magnificent aid to Professor
Smith&rsquo;s faith! For if Essene meant &ldquo;a silent one,&rdquo;
then the pre-Christian Nazarenes must surely have been an esoteric and
secret sect.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

course, it is possible that Jesus, before he comes on the scene, at
about the age of thirty, as a follower of John the Baptist, had been a
member of the Essene sect, as the learned writer of the article on
Jesus in the <i>Jewish Encyclop&aelig;dia</i> supposes. If such a sect
of Nazor&aelig;i, as Epiphanius describes, ever really
existed&mdash;and Epiphanius is an unreliable author&mdash;then Jesus
<i>may</i> have been a member of it. But it is a long way from a
<i>may</i> to a <i>must</i>. Even if it could be proved that Matthew
had such a tradition when he wrote, the proof would not diminish one
whit the absurdity of Professor Smith&rsquo;s contention that he was a
myth and a mere symbol of a God Joshua worshipped by pre-Christian
Nazor&aelig;i. The Nazor&aelig;i of Epiphanius were a Christian sect,
akin to, if not identical with, the Ebionites; and the hypothesis that
they kept up among themselves a secret cult of a God Joshua is as
senseless as it is baseless, and opposed to all we know of them. In
what sense Matthew, that is to say the anonymous compiler of the first
Gospel, understood <i>nazor&aelig;us</i> is clear to anyone who will
take the trouble to read <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=

<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">Is Mark&rsquo;s Gospel a
religious romance?</span> I can imagine some people arguing that
Mark&rsquo;s Gospel might be a religious novel, of which the scene is
laid in Jerusalem and Galilee among Jews; that it was by a literary
artifice impregnated with Jewish ideas; that the references to
Sadducees and Pharisees were introduced as appropriate to the age and
clime; that the old Jewish Scriptures are for the same reason
acknowledged by all the actors and interlocutors as holy writ; that
demonological beliefs were thrown in as being characteristic of
Palestinian society of the time the writer purported to write about;
that it is of the nature of a literary trick that the peculiar
Messianic and Apocalyptic beliefs and aspirations rife among Jews of
the period <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 50&ndash;<span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 160 and later, are made to colour the narrative from
beginning to end. All these elements of verisimilitude, I say, taken
singly or together, do not of necessity exclude the hypothesis that it
may be one of the most skilfully constructed historical novels ever
written. Have we not, it may be urged, in the <i>Recognitions</i> or
Itinerary of Saint Clement, in the Acts of Thomas, in the story of Paul
and Thecla, similar compositions?</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Certainly not in the way assumed by Drews
and Robertson,</span> In view of what we know of the dates and
diffusion of the Gospels, of their literary connections with one
another, and of the reappearance of their chief <i lang=
"la">person&aelig; dramatis</i> in the Pauline letters, such a
hypothesis <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>is of course wildly improbable, yet not utterly
absurd. We have to assume in the writer a knowledge of the Messianic
movement among the Jews, a familiarity with their demonological beliefs
and practices, with their sects, and so forth; and it is all readily
assumable. In the Greek novel of Chariton we have an example of such an
historical romance, the scene being laid in Syracuse and Asia Minor
shortly after the close of the Peloponnesian war. But such romances are
not cult documents of a parabolic or allegorical kind, as the Gospels
are supposed by these writers to be. They do not bring a divine being
down from Olympus, and pretend all through that he was a man who was
born, lived, and died on the cross in a particular place and at a
particular date. We have no other example of documents whose authors,
by way of honouring a God up in heaven who never made any epiphany on
earth nor ever underwent incarnation, made a man of him, and concocted
an elaborate earthly record of him. Why did they do it? What was the
object of the &ldquo;Jesuists&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christists&rdquo; in
hoaxing their own and all subsequent generations and in building up a
lasting cult and Church on what they knew were fables?</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">whose hypothesis is
self-destructive,</span> In the Homeric hymns and other religious
documents not only of the Greeks, but of the Hindoos, we have no doubt
histories of the gods written by their votaries; but in these hymns
they put down what they believed, they did not of set design falsify
the legend of the god, and describe his birth and parentage, when they
knew he never had any; his ministrations and teaching career, when he
never ministered or taught; his persecution by enemies and his death,
when he was never persecuted and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83"
href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>never died. Or are we to suppose
that all these things were related in the Sun-god Joshua legend? No,
reply Messrs. Drews and Robertson. For the stories told in the Gospels
are all modelled on pagan or astral myths; the persons who move in
their pages are the gods and demigods of Egyptian, Greek, Latin, Hindoo
legends. Clearly the Saviour-God Joshua had no legend or story of his
own, or it would not be necessary to pad him out with the furniture and
appurtenances of Osiris, Dionysus, Serapis, &AElig;sculapius, and who
knows what other gods besides. And&mdash;strangest feature of
all&mdash;it is Jews, men circumcised, propagandists of Jewish
monotheism, who, in the interests of &ldquo;a Judaic cult&rdquo; (p.
348), go rummaging in all the dustbins of paganism, in order to
construct a legend or allegory of their god. Why could they not rest
content with him as they found him in their ancient tradition?</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">and irreconcilable with ascertained history
of Judaism</span> The Gospels, like any other ancient document, have to
be accounted for. They did not engender themselves, like a mushroom,
nor drop out of heaven ready written. I have admitted as possible,
though wild and extravagant, the hypothesis of their being a Messianic
romance, which subsequently came to be mistaken for sober history; and
there are of course plenty of legendary incidents in their pages. But
such a hypothesis need not be discussed. It is not that of these three
authors, and would not suit them. They insist on seeing in them so many
manifestoes of the secret sect of Jews who worshipped a god Joshua. For
Dr. Drews and Mr. Robertson the Gospels describe a
&ldquo;Jesuine&rdquo; mystery play evolved &ldquo;from a Palestinian
rite of human sacrifice in which the annual victim was &lsquo;Jesus the
Son of the Father.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; There is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>no trace
in Jewish antiquity of any such rite in epochs which even remotely
preceded Christianity, nor is the survival of such a rite of human
sacrifice even thinkable in Jerusalem, where the
&ldquo;Christists&rdquo; laid their plot. And why should they eke out
their plot with a thousand scraps of pagan mythology?</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Prof. Smith&rsquo;s hypothesis of a
mythical Jesus mythically humanized in a monotheistic
propaganda,</span> I was taught in my childhood to venerate the
Gospels; but I never knew before what really wonderful documents they
are. Let us, however, turn to Professor W. B. Smith, who does not pile
on paganism so profusely as his friends, nor exactly insist on a pagan
basis for the Gospels. His hypothesis in brief is identical with
theirs, for he insists that Jesus the man never existed at all. Jesus
is, in Professor Smith&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;a humanized God&rdquo;;
in the diction of Messrs. Drews and Robertson, a myth. Professor Smith
allows (<i lang="la">Ecce Deus</i>, p. 78) that the mere &ldquo;fact
that a myth, or several myths, may be found associated with the name of
an individual by no means relegates that individual into the class of
the unhistorical.&rdquo; That is good sense, and so is the admission
which follows, that &ldquo;we may often explain the legends from the
presence of the historical personality, <i>independently known to be
historic</i>.&rdquo; But in regard to Jesus alone among the figures of
the past he, like his friends, rules out both considerations. The
common starting-point of all three writers is that the earliest Gospel
narratives do not &ldquo;describe <i>any human character at all</i>; on
the contrary, the individuality in question is <i>distinctly divine and
not human</i>, in the earliest portrayal. As time goes on it is true
that certain human elements do creep in, particularly in Luke and
John&#8202;&hellip;. In Mark there is really no man at all; the Jesus
is God, or at least essentially divine, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>throughout. He wears only
a transparent garment of flesh. Mark historizes only.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">lacks all confirmation, defies the
texts,</span> How is it, we ask, that humanity has pored over the
Synoptic Gospels for nearly two thousand years, and discerned in them
the portraiture at least of a man of flesh and blood, who can be imaged
as such in statuary and painting? Even if it were conceded, as I said
above, that the Gospel representation of Jesus is an imaginary
portrait, like that of William Tell or John Inglesant, still, who, that
is not mad, will deny that there exist in it multiple human traits,
fictions may be of a novelist, yet indisputably there? Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s hardy denial of them can only lead his readers to suspect
him of paradox. Moreover, the champions of traditional orthodoxy have
had in the past every reason to side with Professor Smith in his
attempted elimination of all human traits and characteristics. Yet in
recent years they have been constrained to admit that in Luke and John
the human elements, far from creeping in, show signs of creeping out.
&ldquo;The received notion,&rdquo; adds Professor Smith, &ldquo;that in
the early Marcan narratives the Jesus is distinctly human, and that the
process of deification is fulfilled in John, is precisely the reverse
of the truth.&rdquo; Once more we rub our eyes. In Mark Jesus is little
more than that most familiar of old Jewish figures, an earthly herald
of the imminent kingdom of heaven; late and little by little he is
recognized by his followers as himself the Messiah whose advent he
formerly heralded. As yet he is neither divine nor the incarnation of a
pre-existent quasi-divine Logos or angel. In John, on the other hand,
Jesus has emerged from the purely Jewish phase of being Messiah, or
servant of God (which is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href=
"#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>all that Lord or <i>Son of
God</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e1800src" href="#xd25e1800" name=
"xd25e1800src">1</a> implies in Mark&rsquo;s opening verses). He has
become the eternal Logos or Reason, essentially divine and from the
beginning with God. <span class="marginnote">and rests on an obsolete
and absurd allegorization of them</span>Here obviously we are well on
our way to a deification of Jesus and an elimination of human traits;
and the writer is so conscious of this that he goes out of his way to
call our attention to the fact that Jesus was after all a man of flesh
and blood, with human parents and real brethren who disbelieved in him.
He was evidently conscious that the superimposition on the man Jesus of
the Logos scheme, and the reflection back into the human life of Jesus
of the heavenly <i>r&ocirc;le</i> which Paul ascribed to him <i>qua</i>
raised by the Spirit from the dead, was already influencing certain
believers (called Docetes) to believe that his human life and actions
were illusions, seen and heard indeed, as we see and hear a man speak
and act in a dream, but not objective and real. To guard against this
John proclaims that he was made flesh. Nevertheless, he goes half way
with the Docetes in that he rewrites all the conversations of Jesus,
abolishes the homely parable, and substitutes his own theosophic
lucubrations. He also emphasizes the miraculous aspect of Jesus,
inventing new miracles more grandiose than any in previous gospels, but
of a kind, as he imagines, to symbolize his conceptions of sin and
death. He is careful to eliminate the demonological stories. They were
as much of a stumbling-block to John as we have seen them to be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>to Mr. W. B. Smith. We must, therefore, perforce
accuse the latter of putting a hypothesis that from the outset is a
paradox. The documents contradict him on every page.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Why should the robber chief Joshua have
been selected as prototype of Jesus?</span> A thesis that begins by
flying in the face of the documents demands paradoxical arguments for
its support; and the pages of all three writers teem with them. Of a
Jesus that is God from the first it is perhaps natural to
ask&mdash;anyhow our authors have asked it of themselves&mdash;which
God was he? And the accident of his bearing the name Jesus&mdash;he
might just as well have been called Jacob or Sadoc or Manasseh, or what
not&mdash;suggests Joshua to them, for Joshua is the Hebrew name which
in the LXX was Grecized as <i>Iesou&#275;</i>, and later as
<i>Iesous</i>. That in the Old Testament Joshua is depicted as a
cut-throat and leader of brigands, very remote in his principles and
practice from the Jesus of the Gospels, counts for nothing. The late
Dr. Winckler, who saw sun and moon myths rising like exhalations all
around him wherever he looked in ancient history and
mythology,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1828src" href="#xd25e1828" name=
"xd25e1828src">2</a> has suggested that Joseph was originally a solar
hero. <i>Ergo</i>, Joshua was one too. <i>Ergo</i>, there was a Hebrew
secret society in Jerusalem in the period <span class="sc">B.C.</span>
150&ndash;<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 50 <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>who worshipped the
Sun-God-Saviour Joshua. <i>Ergo</i>, the Gospels are a sustained
parable of this Sun-god. Thus are empty, wild, and unsubstantiated
hypotheses piled one on top of the other, like Pelion on Ossa. Not a
scintilla of evidence is adduced for any one of them. First one is
advanced, and its truth assumed. The next is propped on it, <i>et sic
ad infinitum</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Why make him the central figure of a
monotheistic cult?</span> What, asks Professor Smith (<i lang="la">Ecce
Deus</i>, p. 67), was the active principle of Christianity? What its
germ? &ldquo;The monotheistic impulse,&rdquo; he answers, &ldquo;the
instinct for unity that lies at the heart of all grand philosophy and
all noble religion.&rdquo; Again, p. 45: &ldquo;What was the essence of
this originally secret Jesus cult, that was expressed in such guarded
parabolic terms as made it unintelligible to the multitude?&hellip; It
was a <i>protest against idolatry</i>; it was a <i>Crusade for
monotheism</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The earliest Christianity was no
monotheistic propaganda</span> This is, no doubt, true of Christianity
when we pass outside the Gospels. It is only not true of them, because
on their every page Jewish monotheism is presupposed. Why are no
warnings against polytheism put into the mouth of Jesus? Why is not a
single precept of the Sermon on the Mount directed against idolatry?
Surely because we are moving in a Jewish atmosphere in which such
warnings were unnecessary. The horizon is purely Jewish, either of
Jerusalem as we know it in the pages of Josephus or of certain Galilean
circles in which even a knowledge of Greek seems not to have existed
before the third century. The very proximity of Greek cities there
seems to have confirmed the Jewish peasant of that region in his
preference of Aramaic idiom, just as the native of Bohemia to-day turns
his back on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>you if you address him in the detested German
tongue.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Robertson and Drews allow the Jesuists to
have been mainly Jewish in cult and feeling</span> Messrs. Robertson
and Drews concede that the original stock of Christianity was Jewish.
Thus we read in <i>Christianity and Mythology</i> (p. 415) that the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer derives &ldquo;from pre-Christian Jewish lore, and,
like parts of the Sermon (on the Mount), from an actually current
Jewish document.&rdquo; The same writer admits (p. 338) the existence
of &ldquo;Judaic sections of the early Church.&rdquo; When he talks (p.
337) of the tale of the anointing of Jesus in <a class=
"biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2026:6-13&amp;version=NRSV">
Matthew xxvi, 6&ndash;13</a>, and parallel passages, being &ldquo;in
all probability a late addendum&rdquo; to the &ldquo;primitive
gospel&rdquo; of Bernhard Weiss&rsquo;s theory, &ldquo;made after the
movement had become pronouncedly Gentile,&rdquo; he presupposes that,
to start with anyhow, the movement was mainly Jewish. He admits that in
the first six paragraphs of the early Christian document entitled the
<i><span class="corr" id="xd25e1892" title=
"Source: Didache">Didach&eacute;</span></i> we have a purely Jewish
teaching document, &ldquo;which the Jesuist sect adopted in the first
or second century.&rdquo; He cannot furthermore contest the fact that
the Jesuists &ldquo;took over the Jewish Scriptures as their sacred
book; that they inherited the Jewish passover and the Paschal lamb,
which is still slain in Eastern churches; that the leaders of the
secret sect in Jerusalem upheld the Jewish rite of circumcision against
Paul.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1895src" href="#xd25e1895"
name="xd25e1895src">3</a> All this is inconceivable if the society was
not in the main and originally one of Hebrews. When he goes on to argue
that the Gospels are the manifesto of a cult of an old Sun-god
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>Joshua, son of a mythic Miriam, he at least admits
that the early &ldquo;Christists&rdquo; selected from ancient Jewish
superstition, and not from pagan myth, the central figure of their
cult, and that they chose for their deity a successor and satellite of
Moses with a Hebrew lady for his mother. We may take it for granted,
then, that the parent society out of which the Christian Church arose
was profoundly and radically Jewish; and Mr. Robertson frankly admits
as much when he affirms that &ldquo;it was a <i>Judaic cult that
preached circumcision</i>,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;its apostles with
whom Paul was in contact were of a <i>Judaizing</i> description.&rdquo;
Here is common ground between myself and him.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">If so, how could they devote themselves to
pagan mystery plays?</span> What I want to know is how it came about
that a society of which Jerusalem was the focus, and of which the
nucleus and propagandists were Jews and Judaizers, could have been
given over to the cult of a solar god, and how they could celebrate
mystery plays and dramas in honour of that god; how they can have
manufactured that god into &ldquo;a composite myth&rdquo; (p. 336), and
constructed in his honour a religious system that was &ldquo;a
patchwork of a hundred suggestions drawn from pagan art and ritual
usage.&rdquo; For such, we are told (p. 305), was &ldquo;the Christian
system.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Robertson admits that Jews could never
borrow from pagan rituals in that age</span> We are far better
acquainted with Jewish belief and ritual during the period <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span> 400&ndash;<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 100 than we are
with that of the pagans. The content of the Greek mysteries is an
enigma to our best Hellenists; we know next to nothing of the inside of
Mithraism; for the oriental cults of the late Roman republic and early
empire we are lamentably deficient in writings that might exhibit to us
the <i>arcana</i> of their worship and the texture of their beliefs.
Not so with Judaism. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91"
name="pb91">91</a>]</span>Here we have the prophets, old and late; for
the two centuries <span class="sc">B.C.</span> we have the apocrypha,
including the Maccabean books; we have the so-called Books of Enoch, of
Jubilees, of the Twelve Patriarchs, the Fourth Ezra, Baruch, Sirach,
and many others. We have the voluminous works of Philo and Josephus for
the first century of our era; we have the Babylonian and other Talmuds
preserving to us a wealth of Jewish tradition and teaching of the first
and second centuries. Here let Mr. Robertson speak. As regards the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and the Sermon on the Mount, he insists (p. 415
foll.) that they were inspired by parallel passages in the Talmud and
the Apocrypha, and he argues with perfect good sense for the priority
of the Talmud in these words: &ldquo;It is hardly necessary to remark
here that the Talmudic parallels to any part of the Sermon on the Mount
cannot conceivably have been borrowed from the Christian gospels;
<i>they would as soon have borrowed from the rituals of the
pagans</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Yet affirms that Christists,
indistinguishable from Jews, did so borrow wholesale</span> And yet he
asks us to believe that a nucleus of Jews, hidden in Jerusalem, the
heart of Judaism, a sect whose apostles were Judaizers and vehement
defenders of circumcision&mdash;all this he admits&mdash;were, as late
as the last half of the first century, maintaining among themselves in
secret a highly eclectic pagan cult; that they evolved &ldquo;a gospel
myth from scenes in pagan art&rdquo; (p. 327); that they took a sort of
modern arch&aelig;ological interest in pagan art and sculpture, and
derived thence most of their literary <i>motifs</i>; that the figure of
Jesus is an alloy of Dionysus, Osiris, Adonis, Krishna,
&AElig;sculapius, and fifty other ancient gods and demigods, with the
all-important &ldquo;Sun-God-Saviour Joshua, son of Miriam&rdquo;; that
the story of Peter rests on &ldquo;a pagan basis of myth&rdquo; (p.
340); <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>that Maria is the true and original form of the
Hebrew Miriam, and is the same name as Myrrha and Moira (<span class=
"trans" title="moira"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&mu;&omicron;&#8150;&rho;&alpha;</span></span>), etc., etc.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The central idea of a God Joshua a figment
of Robertson&rsquo;s fancy</span> Such are the mutually destructive
arguments on the strength of which we are to adopt his thesis of the
unhistoricity of Jesus. His books, like those of Dr. Drews, are a
welter of contradictory statements, unreconciled and irreconcilable.
Nevertheless, they reiterate them in volume after volume, like orthodox
Christians reiterating articles of faith and dogmas too sacred to be
discussed. Who ever heard before them of a Jewish cult of a
Sun-God-Saviour Joshua? Such a cult must have been long extinct when
the book of Joshua was written. Who ever heard of this Sun-god having
for his mother a Miriam, until Mr. Robertson discovered a late Persian
gloss to the effect that Joshua, son of Nun, had a mother of the name?
Even if this tradition were not so utterly worthless as it is, it would
prove nothing about the Sun-god. On the basis of such gratuitous
fancies we are asked to dismiss Jesus as a myth. <span class=
"marginnote">It does not even explain the birth legends of the
Christians</span>It does not even help us to understand how the myths
of the Virgin Birth arose. Since when, I would like to know, did we
need such evidence against that legend? If I thought that the rebuttal
of it depended on such evidence, I should be inclined to become a good
Papist and embrace it. It is enough for me to have ascertained, by a
comparison of texts and by a study of early Christian documents, that
it is a late accretion on the traditions of Jesus of Nazareth. That is
the real evidence, if any be wanted, against it. Mr. Robertson admits
that the first two chapters of Luke which are supposed&mdash;perhaps
wrongly&mdash;to embody this legend are &ldquo;a late fabulous
introduction.&rdquo; Again he writes (p. 189): <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>&ldquo;Only the late Third Gospel tells the story
(of <a class="biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=

i</a> and <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=

the narrative (of the Birth) in Matthew, added late as it was to the
original composition, which obviously began at what is now the third
chapter, has no hint of the taxing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Evidence of the Protevangelion</span> This
is good sense, and I am indebted to him for pointing out that so
loosely was the myth compacted that in the Protevangelion (c. 17) the
statement is that it was decreed &ldquo;that all should be enrolled who
were in Bethlehem of Jud&aelig;a,&rdquo; not all Jews over the entire
world.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Robertson assumes the antiquity of the
legend merely to suit his theory</span> Surely all this implies that
the legend of the miraculous birth was no part of the earliest
tradition about Jesus. Nevertheless, it is so important for Mr.
Robertson&rsquo;s thesis (that Jesus was a mythical personage) that he
should from the first have had a mythical mother, that he insists on
treating the whole of Christian tradition, early or late, as a solid
block, and argues steadily that the Virgin Birth legend was an integral
part of it from the beginning. Jesus was a myth; as such he must have
had a myth for a mother. Now a virgin mother is half-way to being a
mythical one. Therefore Mary was a virgin, and must from the beginning
have been regarded as such by the &ldquo;Christists.&rdquo; Such are
the steps of his reasoning.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The &ldquo;Christists&rdquo; at once
extravagantly pagan and extravagantly monotheist and Jewish</span> I
have adduced in the preceding pages a selection of the mythological
equations of Mr. Robertson and Dr. Drews in order that my readers may
realize how faint a resemblance between stories justifies, in their
minds, a derivation or borrowing of one from the other. Nor do they
ever ask themselves how Jewish &ldquo;Christists&rdquo; were likely to
come in contact with out-of-the-way legends of Bacchus or Dionysus, of
Hermes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>of old Pelasgic deities, of Cybele and Attis and
Isis, Osiris and Horus, of Helena Dendrites, of Krishna, of Janus, of
sundry ancient vegetation-gods (for they are up to the newest lights),
of Apollonius of Tyana, of &AElig;sculapius, of Herakles and Oceanus,
of Saoshyant and other old Persian gods and heroes, of Buddha and his
kith and kin, of the Eleusinian and other ancient mysteries. Prick them
with a pin, and out gushes this lore in a copious flood; and every item
of it is supposed to have filled the heads of the polymath authors of
the Christian Gospels. Every syllable of these Gospels, every character
in them, is symbolic of one or another of these gods and heroes. Hear,
O Israel: &ldquo;Christians borrowed myths of all kinds from
Paganism&rdquo; (<i>Christianity and Mythology</i>, p. xii). And we are
pompously assured (p. xxii, <i>op. cit.</i>) that this new
&ldquo;mythic&rdquo; system is, &ldquo;in general, more
&lsquo;positive,&rsquo; more inductive, less <i>&agrave; priori</i>,
more obedient to scientific canons, than that of the previous critics
known to me [<i>i.e.</i>, to Mr. Robertson] who have reached similar
anti-traditional results. It substitutes an anthropological basis, in
terms of the concrete phenomena of mythology, for a
pseudo-philosophical presupposition.&rdquo; Heaven help the new science
of anthropology!</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">A receipt for the concoction of a
gospel</span> And what end, we may ask, had the &ldquo;Jesuists&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Christists&rdquo; (to use Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s jargon) in
view, when they dressed up all this tagrag and bobtail of pagan myth,
art, and ritual, and disguised it under the form of a tale of Messianic
Judaism? For that and nothing else is, on this theory, the basis and
essence of the Gospels. Was it their aim to honour paganism or to
honour Jewish monotheism, when they concocted a &ldquo;Christ
cult&rdquo; which is &ldquo;a synthesis of the two most <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>popular
pagan myth-motives,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1997src" href=
"#xd25e1997" name="xd25e1997src">4</a> with some Judaic elements as
nucleus and some explicit ethical teaching superadded&rdquo; (p. 34).
We must perforce suppose that the Gospels were a covert tribute to the
worth and value of Pagan mythology and religious dramas, to pagan art
and statuary. If we adopt the mythico-symbolical method, they can have
been nothing else. Its sponsors might surely condescend to explain the
alchemy by which the ascertained rites and beliefs of early Christians
were distilled from these antecedents. The effect and the cause are so
entirely disparate, so devoid of any organic connection, that we would
fain see the evolution worked out a little more clearly. At one end of
it we have a hurly-burly of pagan myths, at the other an army of
Christian apologists inveighing against everything pagan and martyred
for doing so, all within a space of sixty or seventy years. I only hope
the orthodox will be gratified to learn that their Scriptures are a
thousandfold more wonderful and unique than they appeared to be when
they were merely inspired by the Holy Spirit. For verbal inspiration is
not, as regards its miraculous quality, in the same field with
mythico-symbolism. Verily we have discovered a new literary genus,
unexampled in the history of mankind. You rake together a thousand
irrelevant thrums of mythology, picked up at random from every age,
race, and clime; you get a &ldquo;Christist&rdquo; to throw them into a
sack and shake them up; you open it, and out come the Gospels. In all

<h2 class="main">THE ARGUMENT FROM SILENCE</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">Multiplicity of documents
converging on and involving an historical Jesus</span> I have remarked
above that if the Gospel of Mark were an isolated writing, if we knew
nothing of its fortunes, nothing of any society that accepted it as
history; if, above all, we were without any independent documents that
fitted in with it and mentioned the persons and events that crowd its
pages, then it would be a possible hypothesis that it was like the
<i>Recognitions</i> of Clement, a skilfully contrived romance. Such a
hypothesis, I said, would indeed be improbable, yet not unthinkable or
self-destructive. But as a matter of fact we have an extensive series
of documents, independent of Mark, yet attesting by their undesigned
coincidences its historicity&mdash;not, of course, in the sense that we
must accept everything in it, but anyhow in the sense that it is
largely founded on fact and is a record of real incident. Were it a
mere romance of events that never happened, and of people who never
lived, would it not be a first-class miracle that in another romance,
concocted apart from it and in ignorance of its contents, the same
outline of events met our gaze, the same personages, the same
atmosphere, moral, intellectual, and religious, the same interests? If
in a third and fourth writing the same phenomenon recurred, the marvel
would be multiplied. Would any sane person doubt that there was a
substratum of fact and real history underlying them all? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>It would
be as if several tables in the gambling saloon of Monte Carlo threw up
the same series of numbers&mdash;say, 8, 3, 11, 7, 33,
21&mdash;simultaneously and independently of one another. A few of the
<i lang="fr">habitu&eacute;s</i>&mdash;for Monte Carlo is a great
centre of superstition&mdash;might take refuge in the opinion that the
tables were bewitched; but most men would infer that there was human
collusion and conspiracy to produce such a result, and that the
croupiers of the several tables were in the plot.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mark and Q the two earliest
documents</span> Now Mark&rsquo;s Gospel does not stand alone. As I
have pointed out in <i>Myth, Magic, and Morals</i>, Luke and Matthew
hold in solution as it were a second document, called Q (<span lang=
"de">Quelle</span>), or the non-Marcan, which yields us a few incidents
and a great many sayings and parables of Jesus. Now this second
document, so utterly separate from and independent of Mark that it does
not even allude to the crucifixion and death episodes, nevertheless has
Jesus all through for its central figure. No doubt it ultimately came
out of the same general medium as Mark; but that consideration does not
much diminish the weight of its testimony. If I met two people a
hundred yards apart both coming from St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, and if
they both assured me that they had just been listening to a sermon of
Dr. Inge&rsquo;s, I should not credit them the less because they had
been together in church.</p>
<p>That both these documents&mdash;I mean Mark and the
non-Marcan&mdash;were in circulation at a fairly early date is certain
on many grounds. So great a scholar as Wellhausen, a scholar
untrammelled by ties of orthodoxy, shows in his commentary that Mark,
as it lies before us, must have been redacted before the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>fall of
Jerusalem in <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 70; so vague are its
forecasts of disasters that were to befall the holy city. In Luke, on
the other hand, these forecasts are accommodated to the facts, as we
should expect to be the case in an author who wrote after the blow had
fallen.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The first and third Gospels constitute two
more such documents</span> And another consideration arises here.
Matthew and Luke wrote quite independently of one another&mdash;for
they practically never join hands across Mark&mdash;and yet they both
assume in their compilations that these two basal documents, Mark and
the non-Marcan, are genuine narratives of real events. They allow
themselves, indeed, according to the literary fashion of the age, to
re-arrange, modify, and omit episodes in them; but their manner of
handling and combining the two documents is in general inexplicable on
the hypothesis that they considered them to be mere romances. They are
too plainly in earnest, too eager to find in them material for the life
of a master whom they revered. Luke in particular prefixes a personal
letter to one Theophilus, explaining the purpose of his compilation. In
it we find not a word about the transcribing of Osiris dramas. On the
contrary, it will set in order for Theophilus a story in which he had
already been instructed. It is clear that Theophilus had already been
made acquainted with &ldquo;the facts about Jesus,&rdquo; perhaps
insufficiently, perhaps along lines which Luke deprecated. <span class=
"marginnote">Luke&rsquo;s prologue argues an indefinite number more of
such documents</span>However this be, Luke desires to improve upon the
information which Theophilus had so far acquired about Jesus. It is
clear that written and unwritten traditions of Jesus were already
disseminated among believers. The prologue is inexplicable otherwise,
and it implies a whole series of witnesses <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>to the
historicity of Jesus prior to Luke himself, of whom, as I have said, we
still have Mark and can reconstruct Q. Both Matthew (whoever he was)
and Luke, then, are convinced of the historicity of Jesus, and regarded
Mark and Q as historical sources. They exploit them, and they also try
to fill up lacunas left in these basal documents, and in particular to
supply their readers with some account of his birth and upbringing.
Both supplements, of course, are largely fictitious, that of Matthew in
particular; but they both testify to a fixed consciousness and belief
among early Christians that the Messiah was a real historical person.
Such an interest in the birth and upbringing of Jesus as Matthew and
Luke reveal could never have been felt by sectaries who were well aware
that he was not a real person, but a solar myth and first cousin of
Osiris. Had he been known, even by a few believers and no more, to have
been not a man but a composite myth, people would not have craved for
details, even miraculous, about his birth and parentage and upbringing.
Was it necessary to concoct human pedigrees for a solar myth, and to
pretend that Jacob begat Joseph, and Joseph begat Jesus? The very idea
is absurd. They wanted such details, and got them, just as did the
worshippers of Plato, Alexander, Augustus, Apollonius, and other famous
men. In connection with Osiris and Dionysus such details were never
asked for and never supplied.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Implications of Luke&rsquo;s
exordium</span> In the covering letter which forms a sort of exordium
to his Gospel the following are the words in which Luke assures us that
others before himself had planned histories of the life of
Jesus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a
narrative concerning those matters which have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>been
fully established (<i>or</i> fulfilled) among us, even as they
delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eye-witnesses and
ministers of the word, it seemed good to me also, having traced out the
course of all things accurately from the first, to write them unto thee
in order, most excellent Theophilus; that thou mightest know the
certainty concerning the things wherein thou wast instructed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not the tone of a man who trades in sun-myths. The passage
has a thoroughly <i>bona fide</i> ring, and declares (1) that
Theophilus had already been instructed in the Gospel narrative, but not
so accurately as the writer could wish; (2) that several accounts of
Jesus&rsquo;s life and teaching were in circulation; (3) that these
accounts were based on the traditions of those who had seen Jesus and
assisted in the diffusion of his Messianic and other teachings.</p>
<p>The passage cannot be later than <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 100,
and is probably as early as <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 80; many
scholars put it earlier. In any case, it reveals a consciousness,
stretching far back among believers, that Jesus had really lived and
died. Moreover, it is from the pen of one who either had himself
visited, with Paul, James the brother (or, according to the orthodox,
the half-brother) of Jesus at Jerusalem (<a class="biblink xd25e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2021:17&amp;version=NRSV">Acts
xxi, 17</a>), or&mdash;if not that&mdash;anyhow had in his possession
and made copious use of a travel document written by the companion of
Paul.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Luke probably used a document independent
of Mark and Q</span> A study of Luke also suggests that he had a third
narrative document of his own. Thus, without going outside the Synoptic
Gospels, we have two, if not three, wholly independent accounts of the
doings and sayings of Jesus, and an inferential certainty that they
were not the only ones which then existed. In the earliest Christian
writers, moreover, citations <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>occur that cannot well be referred
to the canonical Gospels, but which may very well have been taken from
the other narratives which Luke assures us were in the possession of
the earliest Church. These narratives, like all other wholly or partly
independent documents, must have differed widely from one another in
detail; for their authors probably handled the tradition as freely as
Matthew and Luke handle Mark. <span class="marginnote">Messianic and
apocalyptic character of these early documents</span>But the inspiring
motive of them all was the belief that a human Messiah had founded, or
rather begun, the community of believers in Palestine. That any of them
were contemporary is improbable, for the simple reason that the eyes of
believers were turned, not backward on the life of the herald, but
forward to the Kingdom of God or kingdom of heaven on earth which he
heralded. They all felt themselves to be living in the last days, and
that the Kingdom was to surprise many of them during their lifetime.
Nor among the earliest believers was this expectation confined to Jews
alone; it extended equally to Gentile converts. Thus Paul, in his
epistles to the Corinthians, labours to answer the pathetic query his
converts had addressed to him&mdash;namely, why the kingdom to come so
long delayed; why many of them had fallen sick and some had died, while
yet it tarried. Men and women who breathed such an atmosphere of tense
expectation, as a passage like this and as the Gospel parables reveal,
could not be solicitous for annals of the past. Still less is the
attitude revealed that of people nurtured on ritual dramas of an
annually slain and annually resuscitated god; for in that case they
only needed to wait for the manifestation they yearned for, until the
following spring, when the god would rise afresh to secure <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>salvation for his votaries. The tone of this
passage of Paul, as of all the earliest Christian documents, shows that
the mind&rsquo;s eye of the common believer, as had been the
founder&rsquo;s, was dazzled with the apocalyptic splendours soon to be
revealed, with the beatitudes shortly to be fulfilled in the faithful.
They were as wayfarers walking in a dark night towards a light which is
far off, yet, because of its brightness and of the lack of an
interposed landscape to fix the perspective, seems close at hand. Many
a Socialist workman, especially on the continent, cherishes a similar
dream of a good time coming ere long for himself and his fellows. He
has no sense of the difficulties which for many a weary
year&mdash;perhaps for ever&mdash;will hinder the realization of his
passionately desired ideal. It is better so, for we live by our
enthusiasms, and are the better for having indulged in them; if the
labourer had none, he would be a chilly, useless being. Happily the
Socialist seldom reflects how commonplace he would probably find his
ideal if it were suddenly realized around him. Such were the
eschatological hopes and dreams rife in the circles among which the
Synoptic Gospels and their constituent documents first saw the light;
they are revealed on their every page, and, needless to say, are
inexplicable on Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s hypothesis. Devoid of sympathy
with his subject, incapable of seeing it against its true background,
without tact or perspective, he has never felt or understood the
difficulties which beset his central hypothesis. He therefore attempts
no explanation of them.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Character of the Fourth Gospel</span> Of
the Fourth Gospel I have already said whatever is strictly necessary in
this connection. It hangs together with the Johannine epistles; and its
writer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>certainly had the Gospel of Mark before him, for
he derives many incidents from it, and often covertly controverts it.
It seems to belong to the end of the first century, and was in the
hands of Gnostic sects fairly early in the second&mdash;say about 128.
When it was written, the <i>Gnosis</i> of the Hellenized Jews, and in
especial of Philo, was invading the primitive community. The Messianic
and human traits of Jesus, still so salient in Mark and Matthew, though
less so in Luke, are receding into the background before the opinion
that he had been the representation in flesh of the eternal Logos. All
his conversations are re-written to suit the newer standpoint; the
homely scenes and surroundings of Galilee are forgotten as much as can
be, and Samaria and Jerusalem&mdash;a more resounding theatre&mdash;are
substituted. The teaching in parables is dropped, and we hear no more
of the exorcisms of devils. Such things were unedifying, and unworthy
of so sublime a figure, as much in the mind of this evangelist as of
the fastidious Professor W. B. Smith. Hence it may be said that the
Fourth Gospel has made the fortune of the Catholic Church; without it
Athanasius could never have triumphed, nor the Nicene Creed have been
penned, nor Professor Smith&rsquo;s diatribes have attracted readers.
<span class="marginnote">It is half-docetic</span>For in it Jesus is
becoming unreal, a divine pedant masquerading in a vesture of flesh.
When it was written, the Docetes, as they were called, were already
beginning to dot the &ldquo;i&rsquo;s&rdquo; and cross the
&ldquo;t&rsquo;s&rdquo; of the teachers who sublimated Jesus into the
Philonian Logos; and, as I said above, it is against them, no doubt,
that the <i>caveat</i>&mdash;so necessary in the context&mdash;is
entered that in Jesus <i>the Word was made flesh</i>. Similarly, in the
Johannine epistles certain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href=
"#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>teachers are denounced who
declared that Jesus Christ had not come <i>in the flesh</i>, and taught
that his flesh was only a blind. <span class=
"marginnote">Ignatius&rsquo;s account of Docetism</span>We have a
fairly full account of these docetic teachers in the Epistles of
Ignatius, which cannot be much later than <span class="sc">A.D.</span>
120. From these we gather that they adopted the ordinary tradition
about Jesus, and believed that he had been born, and eaten and drunk,
had walked about with his disciples, had delivered his teaching by word
of mouth, had been crucified by Pontius Pilate, had died, and been
buried. But all these operations had been unreal and subjective in the
minds of those who were present at them, as are things we see in a
dream. They had taken place to the eye and ear of bystanders, but not
in reality. The partizans, therefore, of the view that Jesus never
lived deceive themselves when they appeal to the Docetes as witnesses
on their side. The Docetes lend no colour to their thesis of the
non-historicity of Jesus, but just the opposite. Drews writes (p. 57)
that</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">Drews misunderstands
Gnosticism</span>the Gnostics of the second century really questioned
the historical existence of Jesus by their docetic conception; in other
words, they believed only in a metaphysical and ideal, not an
historical and real, Christ. The whole polemic of the Christians
against the Gnostics was based essentially on the fact that the
Gnostics denied the historicity of Jesus, or at least put it in a
subordinate position.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is nonsense. The Docetes admitted to the full that the Messiah
had appeared on earth; but, partly to meet the Jewish objections to a
crucified Messiah, and partly inspired by that contempt for matter
which was and is common in the East, and has been the inspiring motive
of much vain asceticism, they shrank from believing that he shared with
ordinary men <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>their flesh and blood, their secretions and
evacuations. Matter was too evil for a Messiah, much more for the
heavenly <i>Logos</i>, to have been encased in it, and so subjected to
its dominion; to ascribe real flesh to him was to humble him before the
evil Demiurge, who created matter. <span class="marginnote">Docetes
accepted current Christian tradition</span>The Docetes accordingly took
refuge in the idea that his body was a phantom, and that in phantom
form he had undergone all that was related of him in Christian
tradition; to which their views bear testimony, instead of
contradicting it, as Dr. Drews and his friends pretend. &ldquo;If these
things,&rdquo; writes Ignatius, &ldquo;were done by our Lord in
Semblance, then am I also a prisoner in semblance.&rdquo; This means
that&mdash;<i lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i>&mdash;the arguments of the
Docetes would turn Ignatius too, chains and all, into a phantom. Again
and again this writer affirms that the Docetes believed quite correctly
that Jesus was born of a virgin and baptized by John, was nailed up for
our sakes under Pontius Pilate and Herod the Tetrarch, that he
suffered, died, and raised himself up out of the grave. They only would
not believe that he underwent and performed all this
<i>truly</i>&mdash;that is, objectively. They insisted that the Saviour
had only been among men as a phantom, in the same manner as Helen had
gone through the siege of Troy as a mere phantom. She was not really
there, though Greeks and Trojans saw and met her daily. She was all the
time enjoying herself amid the asphodel meadows of the Nile. Even so
the disciples, according to the Docetes, had heard and seen Jesus all
through his ministry; yet the body they saw was phantasmal only. The
Docetes also argued&mdash;so we can infer from Ignatius&rsquo;s Epistle
to the Church of Smyrna&mdash;that, as Jesus ate and drank <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>after the resurrection in phantom guise, so he
had eaten and drunk before his death in no other than phantom guise.
The answer of Ignatius to this is: &ldquo;I know and believe that he
was in the flesh even after the resurrection&rdquo;; and he forthwith
relates how the risen Jesus approached Peter and his company, who
thought they were in the presence of a phantom or ghost, and said to
them: &ldquo;<i>Lay hold and handle me, and see that I am not a demon
without a body</i>.&rdquo; Everything, then, that we read about the
Docetes shows that on all points, in respect of the miraculous
incidents of Jesus&rsquo;s life no less than of the natural, they
blindly accepted the record of evangelical tradition. Their heresy was
not to deny what the tradition related, but to interpret it wrongly.
<span class="marginnote">Docetism in Philo,</span> Philo had long
before set the example of such an interpretation, when in his
commentaries, which were widely read by Christians in the second
century, he asserted that the angels who appeared to Abraham at the oak
of Mambre, and ate and drank with him, only ate and drank in semblance,
and not in reality. They laid a spell on the eyes of Abraham, and of
the other guests at the banquet. <span class="marginnote">and in
Tobit</span>So in the Book of <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Tb%2012:19&amp;version=NRSV">
Tobit xii, <span class="corr" id="xd25e2156" title=
"Source: 20, 21">19</span></a>, the angel says: &ldquo;All these days
did I appear unto you; and I did neither eat nor drink, but it was a
vision ye yourselves saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same way, Jesus laid a spell on the eyes of his followers, in
the belief of this very early sect of Christian believers. <span class=
"marginnote">Professor Smith and Hippolytus</span> Professor W. B.
Smith, like his two companions, writes as if Docetism were an asset in
favour of his thesis that Christianity began as the cult of a slain
God, and that &ldquo;the humanization of this divinity proceeds apace
as we descend the stream of tradition.&rdquo; Yet the Docetic doctrine,
as given in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107"
name="pb107">107</a>]</span>report of Hippolytus, and adduced by Mr.
Smith himself (p. 88), exactly bears out the estimate of its import
with which one rises from a study of the Ignatian Epistles. It is from
Hippolytus&rsquo;s <i>Refutation of Heresies</i>, viii, 10, and runs
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Having come from above, he (Jesus) put on the begotten
(body), and <i>did all things just as has been written in the
Gospels</i>; he washed himself in Jordan, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hippolytus was in contact with Docetes, and familiar with their
writings and arguments. What better proof could we have than this
citation of the fact that they servilely adopted the traditions of
Jesus recorded in the Gospels? They were not supplying an answer to
imaginary Jews who had objected to Christianity on the score that Jesus
had never lived. Their speciality was to interpret the Gospel record,
which they did not dream of disputing, along phantasmagoric lines.
There was still left in the Church enough common sense and historic
insight to brush their interpretation on one side as nonsensical.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Drews misunderstands Justin Martyr</span>
Drews once more has conjured up out of Justin Martyr a Jew of the
second century who denied the human existence of Jesus. The relevant
passage is at p. 16 of his <i>Witnesses to the Historicity of
Jesus</i>, and runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is not true, however, as has recently been stated,
that no Jew ever questioned the historical reality of Jesus, so that we
may see in this some evidence for his existence. The Jew Trypho, whom
Justin introduces in his <i>Dialogue with Trypho</i>, expresses himself
very sceptically about it. &ldquo;Ye follow an empty rumour,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;and make a Christ for yourselves.&rdquo; &ldquo;If he was
born and lived somewhere, he is entirely unknown&rdquo; (viii, 3). This
work appeared in the second half of the second century; it is therefore
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>the first indication of a denial of the human
existence of Jesus, and shows that such opinions were current at the
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professor Drews has, I regret to say, failed to read his text
intelligently. So I will transcribe the passage of Justin in full,
premising that it was more probably written in the first than in the
second half of the second century. The dialogue is between a Jew and an
ex-Platonist who has turned Christian, and the Jew says with an
ironical smile to the Christian:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The rest of your arguments I admit, and I admire your
religious enthusiasm. Nevertheless, you would have done better to stick
to Plato&rsquo;s or any other sage&rsquo;s philosophy, practising the
virtues of endurance and continence and temperance, rather than let
yourself be ensnared by false arguments and follow utterly worthless
men. For if you had remained loyal to that form of philosophy and lived
a blameless life, there was left a hope of your rising to something
better. But as it is you have abandoned God and put your trust in man,
so what further hope is left to you of salvation? If, then, you are
willing to take advice from myself&mdash;for I already have come to
regard you as a friend&mdash;begin first by circumcising yourself, and
next keep in the legal fashion the sabbath and the festivals and the
new moons of God, and in a word fulfil all the commandments written in
the Law, and then perhaps you will attain unto God&rsquo;s mercy. But
Messiah (<i>or</i> Christ), even supposing he has come into being and
exists somewhere or other, <i>is unrecognized, and can neither know
himself as such nor possess any might, until</i> Elias having come
shall anoint him and make him manifest unto all. But you (Christians),
having lent ear to a vain report, feign a sort of Messiah unto
yourselves, and for his sake are now rashly going to perdition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a parallel passage in the Dialogue, c. cx, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>where the Christian interlocutor, after reciting
the prophecy of <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mi%204:1-7&amp;version=NRSV">
Micah, iv, 1&ndash;7</a>, adds these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I am quite aware, gentlemen, that your rabbis admit
all the words of the above passage to have been uttered about, and to
refer to the Messiah; and I also know that they deny him so far to have
come, or, if they say he has come, then that it is not yet known who he
is. However, when he is manifested and in glory, then, they say, it
will be known who he is. And then, so they say, the things foreshadowed
in the above passage will come to pass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Jews in Justin testify to Jesus&rsquo;s
historicity</span> The sense, then, of the passage adduced by Drews is
perfectly clear, and exactly the opposite of that which he puts upon
it. The Christ or Messiah referred to by the Jew is not that man of
Nazareth in whom the Christians had falsely recognized the signs of
Messiahship. No, he is, on the contrary, the Messiah expected by the
Jews; but the latter has not so far come; or, if he has come, still
lurks in some corner unrecognized until such time as Elias, to whom the
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> appertains, shall appear again and proclaim him.
There is not a word of Jesus of Nazareth not having come, or of his
being still unrecognized. The gravamen of the Jew is that the
ex-Platonist had been chicaned by Christians into believing that the
Messiah <i>had already come</i> in the person of Jesus, and had been
recognized in him. The passage, therefore, has exactly the opposite
bearing to what Drews imagines.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Second century Jews did not detest mere
shadows</span> There is, too, another very significant point to be made
in this connection. It is this, that the Jews of that age would not
have borne the bitter grudge they did against the Christians if the
latter had merely devoted themselves to the cult of a mythical
personage, a Sun-God-Saviour, who never existed at all. They
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>were quite well capable of ridiculing myths of
such a kind, as the story of Bel and the Dragon shows. Jesus, however,
was a real memory to them, and one which they detested. Their hatred
for him was that which you bear for a man who has upset your religion
and trampled on your prejudices&mdash;the sort of hatred that Catholics
have for the memory of Luther and Calvin; it was not in any way akin to
their mockery of idols, their disgust for the demons that inhabited
them, their abhorrence of their votaries. It was hatred of a religious
antagonist, <i lang="la">odium theologicum</i> of the purest kind, and
hatred like that with which the Ebionites for generations hated the
memory of Paul. Jesus had violated and set at naught the law of Moses.
A solar myth could not do that.</p>
<p>To this hatred of the Jews for the memory of Jesus, and to the early
date at which it showed itself, Dr. Drews himself bears witness when,
on p. 12 of the work cited, he writes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">There is no room for doubt that after the destruction
of Jerusalem, and especially <i>during the first quarter of the second
century, the hostility of the Jews and Christians increased</i>;
indeed, by the year 130 the hatred of the Jews for the Christians
became so fierce that a rabbi whose niece had been bitten by a serpent
preferred to let her die rather than see her healed &ldquo;in the name
of Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

argues from this and similar <span class="corr" id="xd25e2249" title=
"Corrected by author from: passages">episodes</span> that the Rabbis of
the second half of the first century, or the beginning of the second,
were well acquainted with the <i>person</i> of Christ.
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says Drews, &ldquo;he clearly deceives himself and
his readers if the impression is given that they had any personal
knowledge of him.&rdquo; The self-deception is surely on the part of
Dr. Drews. Chwolson does not imply that any <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>Rabbis of the years 50&ndash;100 had a personal
knowledge of Jesus, in the sense of having seen him or conversed with
him; for he is not given to writing nonsense. He does, however, imply
that they knew of him as a real man who had lived and done them a power
of evil. If they had only known him as a solar myth, their hostility to
his followers, admitted by Drews, would be inexplicable; equally
inexplicable if, as Dr. W. B. Smith contends, he had been a merely
heavenly power, a divine Logos or God, incidentally the object of a
monotheist cult. In that case the Jews would rather have been inclined
to fall on the neck of the Christians and welcome them; and their cult
would have been no more offensive to them than the theosophy of Philo
the Jew, from which it would have been hardly distinguishable. Justin
Martyr furthermore makes statements on this point which perfectly agree
with the story of the hostile Rabbi adduced by Drews. <span class=
"marginnote">In the Jewish synagogues Jesus was regularly
execrated</span>Not in one, but in half-a-dozen, passages he testifies
that in his day the Jews in all their synagogues, at the conclusion of
their prayers, cursed the memory of Jesus, execrated his name and
personality (for <i>name</i> meaned <i>personality</i> in that age),
and poured ridicule on the <i lang="fr">soi-disant</i> Messiah that had
been crucified by the Romans. &ldquo;Even to this day,&rdquo; Justin
exclaims (ch. xciii), &ldquo;you persevere in your wickedness,
imprecating curses on us because we can prove that he whom you
crucified is Messiah.&rdquo; He records (ch. cviii) &ldquo;that the
Jews chose and appointed emissaries whom they sent forth all over the
world to proclaim that a godless heresy and unlawful had been vamped up
by a certain Jesus, a charlatan of Galilee. They were to warn their
compatriots that the disciples had stolen him <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>out
of the tomb in which, after being unnailed from the cross, he had been
laid, and then pretended that he had been raised from the dead and
ascended into heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Eusebius&rsquo;s evidence on this
point</span> At first sight the above is a mere <i lang=
"fr">r&eacute;chauff&eacute;</i> of <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2028:13&amp;version=NRSV">
Matt. xxviii, 13</a>; but Eusebius, who had in his hands much first-
and second-century literature of the Christians and Hellenized Jews
that we have not, attests a similar tradition, and declares that he
found it in the publications of the ancients.<a class="noteref" id=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">The priests and elders of the Jewish race who lived in
Jerusalem wrote epistles and sent them broadcast to the Jews everywhere
among the Gentiles, calumniating the teaching of Christ as a brand-new
heresy and alien to God; and they warned them by letters not to receive
it. And their apostles took their epistles, written on papyrus &hellip;
and ran up and down the earth, maligning our account of the
Saviour&#8202;&hellip;. It is still the custom of the Jews to give the
name of Apostles to those who carry encyclical letters from their
rulers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that Eusebius does not weave in the story of the disciples
stealing their Master&rsquo;s body from out of the tomb. From his
omission of it, and from the dissimilarity of his language, we can
infer that the &ldquo;publications of the ancients&rdquo; from which he
derived his information were not the works of Justin, but an
independent source, which may also have been in Justin&rsquo;s hands.
In any case, the Jews were not given to tilting at windmills; their
secular and bitter hatred of the very name of Jesus, the relentless war
waged with pen and sword from the first between the Christians
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>and themselves&mdash;all this is attested by the
earliest writings of the Church. It already colours Luke&rsquo;s
Gospel, and is a leading inspiration of the Johannine. It alone is
all-sufficient to dissipate the hypotheses of these twentieth-century
fabulists.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Evidence of Acts</span> Let us turn to the
Acts of the Apostles, the only book of the New Testament which contains
a history of the Apostolic age. In the last half of this book is
embedded, as even Van Manen admitted, a travel document or narrative of
voyage undertaken by its author in common with Paul. Whether or no the
fellow-traveller was the compiler of the Third Gospel and of Acts is
not certain; but he was assuredly a man named Luke. It does not matter.
&ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; writes Dr. Drews (<i>Christ Myth</i>, p.
19),</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">the imagined historical Jesus, but, if anyone, Paul,
who is that &ldquo;great personality&rdquo; that called Christianity
into life as a new religion; and the depth of his moral experience gave
it the strength for its journey, the strength which bestowed upon it
victory over the other competing religions. Without Jesus the rise of
Christianity can be quite well understood; without Paul, not so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="marginnote">Van Manen on Acts and Paul</span> We infer
from the above that, on the whole, Drews accepts the narrative of
Paul&rsquo;s sayings and doings as given in Acts, and does not consider
it a mere record of the feats a solar hero performed, not on earth, but
in heaven. We gather also that Mr. Robertson takes the same indulgent
view of Acts, for he frequently impugns the age of the Pauline epistles
and the evidence they contain on the strength of &ldquo;Van
Manen&rsquo;s thesis of the non-genuineness&rdquo; of them. &ldquo;In
point of fact,&rdquo; he writes (p. 453), &ldquo;Van Manen&rsquo;s
whole case is an argument; Dr. Carpenter&rsquo;s is a simple
declaration.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114"
name="pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p>But Van Manen never for a moment questioned the historical reality
of Jesus. What he insisted upon is<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2315src"
href="#xd25e2315" name="xd25e2315src">2</a> that</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">there is no word, nor any trace, of any essential
difference as regards faith and life between Paul and other
disciples&#8202;&hellip;. He is a &ldquo;disciple&rdquo; among the
&ldquo;disciples.&rdquo; What he preaches is substantially nothing else
than what their mind and heart are full of&mdash;the things concerning
Jesus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Van Manen, however, allows</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">that Paul&rsquo;s journeyings, his protracted sojourn
outside of Palestine, his intercourse in foreign parts with converted
Jews and former heathen, may have emancipated him (as it did so many
other Jews of the Dispersion) without his knowing it, more or
less&mdash;perhaps in essence completely&mdash;from circumcision and
other Jewish religious duties, customs, and rites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concerning Paul the same writer says (<i>op. cit.</i>, art,
&ldquo;Paul&rdquo;) that Acts gives us</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">a variety of narratives concerning him, differing in
their dates, and also in respect of the influences under which they
were written&#8202;&hellip;. With regard to Paul&rsquo;s journeys, we
can in strictness speak with reasonable certainty and with some detail
only of one great journey, which he undertook towards the end of his
life. (<a class="biblink xd25e45" title=

<p><span class="marginnote">Evidence of the <i>we</i> sections of
Acts</span> It is upon Acts, then, that Van Manen bases his estimate,
which we just now cited, of Paul&rsquo;s relations with the other
disciples. He refuses, and rightly, &ldquo;to assume that Acts must
take a subordinate place in comparison with the principal epistles of
Paul.&rdquo; In effect, his assault on the Pauline Epistles rests on
the assumption that the record of Paul&rsquo;s activity presented in
Acts is the more trustworthy wherever <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>it appears to
conflict with the Pauline Epistles, and in particular with Galatians.
In accepting Van Manen&rsquo;s conclusion, Mr. Robertson implicitly
accepts his premises, one of which is the superior reliability of Acts
in general, and in particular of the four sections enumerated above,
and characterized by the use of the word &ldquo;we.&rdquo; For the
moment, therefore, let us confine ourselves to the ninety-seven verses
of these &ldquo;we&rdquo; sections, which are obviously from the pen of
a fellow-traveller of Paul. We find it recorded in them that Paul was
moved by a <i>vision</i> to go and <i>preach the Gospel</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2368src" href="#xd25e2368" name="xd25e2368src">3</a>
in Macedonia; that at Philippi a certain woman named Lydia, who already
<i>worshipped God</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, was a heathen converted to
Jewish monotheism&mdash;had opened her heart in consequence to give
heed to the things spoken by Paul. We infer that Paul&rsquo;s Gospel
supplemented in some way her monotheism. She and her household became
something more than mere worshippers of God, and were <i>baptized</i>.
We learn that Paul and his companion reckoned time by the Jewish feasts
and fasts&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, by the days of unleavened bread&mdash;but
at the same time were in the habit of meeting together with the rest of
the faithful on the first day of the week, in order to break bread and
discourse about the faith. At Tyre, as at Troas, they found
&ldquo;disciples&rdquo; who, like Paul, arranged future events, or were
warned of them <i>through the Spirit</i>. At C&aelig;sarea, of
Palestine, they stayed with <i>Philip the evangelist</i>, who was one
of <i>the seven</i>, and had four daughters&mdash;<i>virgins who did
prophesy</i>. They also met there a certain <i>prophet Agabus</i>, who
was a mouthpiece of the Holy Ghost, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>and as such foretold
that the Jews at Jerusalem, of whose plots against Paul we elsewhere
hear in these sections, would <i>deliver him into the hands of the
Gentiles</i>. Paul, in his turn, declares his readiness to be bound and
die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e2405" title=
"Corrected by author from: At Cyprus they stay with an early disciple">they
stay with <i>an early disciple</i> from Cyprus</span>, Mnason, and, on
reaching Jerusalem, <i>the brethren received them</i> gladly. And the
day following <i>Paul went in with us unto James; and all the
elders</i> (of the Church) <i>were present</i>. Paul relates to them
the facts of his <i>ministry among the Gentiles</i>. In the course of
the final voyage to Rome, when all the crew have despaired of their
lives, because of the violence of the storm and of the ship leaking,
Paul comes to the rescue, and informs them that the angel of the God
whom he served, and whose he was, had stood by him in the night,
saying: &ldquo;<i>Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before
C&aelig;sar</i>.&rdquo; He therefore could not perish by shipwreck, nor
they either. In Melita the trivial circumstance that the bite of a
viper, promptly shaken off by him into the fire, did not cause Paul to
swell up (<i>i.e.</i>, his hand to be inflamed), or die, caused the
barbarians to acclaim him as a god; and in the sequel the sick in the
island flock to him, and are healed. At Puteoli Paul and his companion
find <i>brethren</i>, as they had found them at Jerusalem and
elsewhere; and presently they enter Rome.</p>
<p>In these sections, then, we have glimpses of a brotherhood
disseminated all about the Mediterranean whose members were Monotheists
of the Jewish type, but something besides, in so far as they accepted a
<i>gospel</i> which Paul also preached, about a Lord Jesus Christ;
these brethren solemnly broke bread on the first day of the week. In
these sections we breathe <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href=
"#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>the same atmosphere of personal
visions, of angels, of prophecy, of direct inspiration of individuals
by the Holy Ghost, of the cult of virginity, which we breathe in the
rest of Acts and throughout the Pauline Epistles. <span class=
"marginnote">Philip one of the seven</span>We meet also with a Philip,
an <i>evangelist</i>, and <i>one of the seven</i>. Who were the seven?
We turn to an earlier chapter of Acts,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2455src" href="#xd25e2455" name="xd25e2455src">4</a> and read
that in the earliest days of the religion at Jerusalem, in order to
satisfy the claims of the widows of Greek Jews who were neglected in
the daily ministration, the <i>twelve apostles</i> had called together
the multitude of the faithful, and chosen <i>seven men</i> of good
report, <i>full of the Spirit</i> and of wisdom to <i>serve the
tables</i>, because they, the Twelve, were too busy preaching the word
to attend to the catering of the new Messianic society. The first on
the list of these seven deacons was <i>Stephen</i>, the second
<i>Philip</i>. When, therefore, in the later passage the
fellow-traveller of Paul refers to Philip as one of <i>the seven</i>,
he assumes that we know who <i>the seven</i> were; and he can only
expect us to know it because we have read the earlier chapter which
narrates their appointment. The fellow-traveller of Paul, therefore,
was aware of the appointment of the seven deacons, and testifies
thereto. Here we have irrefragable evidence of the historicity of
verses 1&ndash;6 of chapter vi of Acts, and at the same time a strong
presumption that the fellow-traveller of Paul was himself the redactor,
if not the author, of the earlier chapters (i&ndash;xv) of Acts, as he
is obviously of the last half (ch. xvi to end); for that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>last
half coheres inseparably with the contiguous <i>we</i> sections.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Literary unity of Acts</span> Have we,
then, any way of testing this presumption that the fellow-traveller who
penned these <i>we</i> sections also penned the rest of Acts? We have,
though it is one which can only appeal to trained philologists, and I
doubt if Messrs. Drews and Robertson are likely to give to such an
argument its due weight. The linguistic evidence of the <i>we</i>
sections has been sifted and tested by Sir John Hawkins in his <i lang=
"la">Hor&aelig; Synoptic&aelig;</i>. The statistic of words and phrases
cannot lie. It proves that the writer of Acts, and consequently of the
Third Gospel, &ldquo;was from time to time a companion of Paul in his
travels, and that he simply and naturally wrote in the first person
when narrating events at which he had been present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the best hypothesis which a study of the language of Acts
and of the Third Gospel permits us to accept. I do not say it is the
only possible one, and I expect Mr. Robertson and his pupil, Dr. Drews,
to reject it with scorn, for their philology is of the sort which
recognizes in Maria the same name as <i>Moira</i> and Myrrha. The only
other explanations of the presence of <i>we</i> in these sections are,
either that a compiler who used the diary of the fellow-traveller left
it standing in the document when he embodied it in his narrative,
through carelessness and by accident, or else that he left it of set
design, and because he wished his readers to identify him with the
older reporter, and so to pass for a companion of Paul. The first of
these explanations is very improbable; the second not only much too
subtle, but out of keeping with the babbling, but credulous, honesty
which everywhere shows itself in Acts. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Van Manen&rsquo;s system of dating Luke and
Acts would postpone all ancient literature to the Middle Ages</span> It
is true that Van Manen assumes <i>a priori</i>, and without a shadow of
proof, that Luke and Acts were written as late as the period
125&ndash;150. His only argument is that Marcion already had the former
in his hands as early as 140; and he is prone to make the childish
assumption that the date of composition of any book in the New
Testament is exactly that of its earliest ascertainable use by a later
author. Such a mode of reasoning is utterly false and uncritical, and
would, if applied in other fields, prove that the great mass of ancient
literature was not ancient at all, but composed in the tenth or later
centuries to which our earliest MSS. belong; for we have no citations
either in contemporary or in nearly contemporary writers of nine-tenths
of the whole volume of the old Greek and Latin literatures. Most of it,
if we applied Van Manen&rsquo;s canons of evidence (which, of course,
are accepted and improved upon by the three writers I am criticizing),
would turn out to have been written as late as the renaissance of
European learning. It is a fallacious test, and Van Manen would have
shrunk from the paradox of enforcing it in regard to any other
literature than the New Testament. It would appear as if the orthodox
traditionalists, by insisting that the Bible must not be judged and
criticized like other books, have prejudiced not merely their own
cause&mdash;that would not matter&mdash;but the cause of sober history.
They have invested it with such an atmosphere of mystery and falsetto,
with what I may call a Sunday-school atmosphere, that a certain class
of inquirers rush to an opposite extreme, and insist on canons of
evidence and authenticity which would, if consistently used, eliminate
all ancient literature and history. One form of error provokes the
other. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=

<p><span class="marginnote">Ephrem&rsquo;s commentary on Acts</span> We
have examined for their evidence as regards the Early Church those
sections which directly evidence the hand of a companion of Paul, who
was probably Luke the physician, seeing that tradition was unanimous in
ascribing the Third Gospel and Acts to him. Some scholars have observed
that the old Syriac version cited by Ephrem the Syrian in his
commentary<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2524src" href="#xd25e2524" name=
"xd25e2524src">5</a> on Acts read in <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=

Acts xx, 13</a>, as follows: &ldquo;But <i>I, Lucas, and those with
me</i>, going before to the ship, set sail for Assos,&rdquo; where the
conventional text reads: &ldquo;But <i>we</i>, going before.&rdquo; The
pronoun <i>we</i> in this passage cannot include, as it usually does,
Paul, who had taken another route and had left directions that they
should call for him; this may have led Ephrem to substitute the
paraphrase <i>I, Lucas, and those with me</i>. Anyhow, without further
evidence, we can hardly use Ephrem&rsquo;s citation as a proof of the
Lucan authorship of Acts. <span class="marginnote">Evidence of those
parts of Acts which cohere with the <i>we</i> sections</span>But we
must anyhow consider the evidence as to Paul&rsquo;s beliefs which is
to be gathered from the sections of Acts which immediately cohere with
the travel document, and which clearly depended for their information
on a source closely allied to them and of the same age and provenance.
Firstly, then, it is noticeable that all this last part of Acts is
relatively free from the fabulous details which mar the earlier part
descriptive of the exploits of Peter. Next we note that Paul, on
entering a city, goes straight to the Jewish Synagogue, and that the
gospel with which he undertakes to supplement their monotheism
consisted not of tidings about an ancient Palestinian Sun-god named
Joshua, or Dionysus or Krishna, or Osiris, or &AElig;sculapius, or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>Mithras, nor about a vegetation or harvest demon
of any kind, nor about any of the other members of the Christian
pandemonium invented by Mr. Robertson and adopted by Dr. Drews. No; on
the contrary, at Thessalonica Paul spent three sabbaths trying to
convince the Jews in their synagogue that Jesus must have been the
Jewish Messiah promised in the Jewish scriptures, because in accordance
with prophecy he had suffered and risen from the dead. That he taught
them, further, that Jesus, <i>qua</i> Christ or Messiah, was also the
Jewish king whose advent they looked for, is obvious from the fact that
he was accused on this occasion, as on others, of teaching,
&ldquo;contrary to the decrees of C&aelig;sar, that there was another
king, one Jesus.&rdquo; At Corinth Paul found he was wasting time in
trying to persuade the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah whose advent
they expected; and he declared to them that thenceforth he would devote
himself to spreading his good news among the Gentiles. None the less he
persisted, wherever he afterwards went, in going first to the
synagogue, so as to give his compatriots a prior chance of accepting
his spiritual wares, according to the principle enunciated in his
epistles, that the promises were for the Jews first and only after them
for the Gentiles. In <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2025:19&amp;version=NRSV">
Acts xxv, 19</a>, Festus lays before King Agrippa the case against Paul
as he had learned it from the Jewish priests and elders at Jerusalem.
It amounted to this, that Paul affirmed that &ldquo;one Jesus, who was
dead, was really alive.&rdquo; We learn in an earlier passage that Paul
was a Jew of Tarsus, an adherent of the Pharisaic sect which believed
in a general resurrection of good Jews, that nevertheless he had
persecuted the adherents of Jesus of Nazareth and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>connived at the murder of Stephen. He has some
difficulty in convincing the Roman governor of Jud&aelig;a that he is
not a leader of the Jewish <i lang="la">sicarii</i>, or sect of
assassins, who were ever anxious to range themselves on the side of any
Messiah ready to show fight against the Roman Legions. The impression
made on Festus, the Roman Governor, by Paul&rsquo;s prophetic arguments
about a Messiah who had suffered and then risen from the dead was

href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026:24&amp;version=NRSV">Acts
xxvi, 24</a>) that &ldquo;much learning had made him mad.&rdquo; We can
discern all through this last half of Acts that attitude of Paul to
Jesus which confronts us in his epistles. Nothing interests him except
his death on the cross and his resurrection. Of the rest of his career
we learn nothing. In one passage, ch. xiii, 26 foll., we have a
slightly more detailed account of the staple of Paul&rsquo;s teaching,
as delivered to the Jews when he encountered them in their synagogues.
He informed them of how &ldquo;they that dwell in Jerusalem and their
rulers&rdquo; had condemned Jesus; &ldquo;though they found no cause of
death in him, yet asked they of Pilate that he should be slain.&rdquo;
They afterwards &ldquo;took him down from the tree and laid him in a
tomb. But God raised him from the dead: and he was seen for many days
of them that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now
his witnesses unto the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is not much of a vegetation-god story about the above concise
narrative, which, however, is strikingly independent of the Gospel
legends concerning the burial and resurrection of Jesus; for, according
to them, it was the friends and adherents of Jesus, and not the rulers,
who condemned him, that were careful to bury him; and his
post-resurrectional <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123"
name="pb123">123</a>]</span>appearances are here confined to his
Galilean followers, who, by virtue of their longer association and
intimacy with him, would be more likely than others to see him after
death in dreams and visions.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Six independent and early documents involve
a real Jesus</span> I have now reviewed the historical books of the New
Testament. We have in them at least six monuments&mdash;to wit, Mark,
the non-Marcan document, the parts of the First and Third Gospels
peculiar to their authors, the Fourth Gospel, and the history of Paul
and his mission given in chapters xiii to xxviii of Acts. Perhaps I
ought to add the first twelve chapters of Acts, of which the
information, according to Van Manen, was derived from an early and lost
document, the Acts of Peter. That would make seven monuments. Unless
all philological analysis is false, the Third Gospel and Acts are from
the pen of a companion of Paul, and cannot be set later than about 90
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> Mark, which he used, must be indefinitely
earlier, and I have pointed out that there are good reasons for setting
its date before the year 70. The non-Marcan document, which critics
have agreed to call Q (<span lang="de">Quelle</span>), cannot be later
than Mark, and is probably much earlier, judging from the fact that it
as yet reported no miracles of Jesus, nor hints of his death and
resurrection. Now all these documents are independent of one another in
style and contents, yet they all have a common interest&mdash;namely,
the memory of a historical man Jesus; and such data as they isolatedly
afford about Jesus agree on the whole as closely as any profane
documents ever agreed which, being written independently and from very
different standpoints, yet refer to one and the same person. If we see
a number of convergent rays of light streaming down under clouds across
a widely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>extended landscape, we infer a central sun
behind the clouds by which they are all emitted. Similarly, we have
here several traditions and documents which converge on a single man,
and are all and severally meaningless, and their genesis impossible of
explanation unless we assume that he lived. It is sufficiently
incredible that one tradition should (to take the hypothesis of
non-historicity in its most rational form&mdash;that, namely, of
Professor W. B. Smith) allegorize the myth of a Saviour God as the
career of a man, and that man a Galilean teacher, in whose humanity the
Church believed from the first. That six or seven parallel traditions
should all have hit on the same form of deception and allegory is, as I
said before, as incredible as that several roulette tables at Monte
Carlo should independently and at one and the same time throw up an
identical series of numbers. <i lang="la">Credat Jud&aelig;us
Apella</i>, These writers who develop the thesis of the non-historicity
of Jesus because miracles came to be attributed to him&mdash;how could
they not in that age and social medium?&mdash;ask us to believe in a
miracle which far outweighs any which any religionists ever reported of
their founder; they themselves have fallen into fathomless depths of
credulity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=

<h2 class="main">THE EPISTLES OF PAUL</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s vital
interpolations</span> Now let us turn to the Epistles of Paul, a person
whom these writers, as we have seen above, admit to have lived, and to
have played no small part in the establishment of Christianity.</p>
<p>In using these Epistles, they all three make a reservation to the
effect that any evidence which they may supply in favour of the
historicity of Jesus, and which cannot be explained away, shall be
regarded as an interpolation; and as it is something that slays his
hypothesis, Mr. Robertson has taught us to call such evidence
&ldquo;vital interpolation.&rdquo; It must die in order that his
hypothesis may live. They also claim, <i lang="la">ab initio</i>, to
deny Pauline authorship to any epistles that may turn out to be a
stumbling-block in the way of their theories, and lean to the view of
Van Manen and others, who held that the entire mass of the Pauline
letters are the &ldquo;work of a whole school of second-century
theologians&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, forgeries of the period
130&ndash;140. <span class="marginnote">Defying textual evidence he
relegates the Paulines to second century</span>They would, of course,
set them later than that, only it is overwhelmingly certain that
Marcion made about that time a collection of ten of them, which he
expurgated to suit his views, and arranged in order, with Galatians
first; this collection he called the <i>Apostolicon</i>. It runs
somewhat counter to this view that, twenty years earlier, we already
have a reference to these Epistles in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>Ignatius, who, with
an exaggeration hardly excused by the fact that he is addressing
members of the Ephesian Church, informs us that the Ephesians are
mentioned &ldquo;in every letter&rdquo; by Paul. Those who desire ample
proof that Ignatius was well acquainted with Paul&rsquo;s Epistles
cannot do better than refer to a work, drawn up and published in 1905
by members of the Oxford Society of Historical Theology, entitled
<i>The New Testament in the Apostolic Fathers</i>. In this the New
Testament originals and the citations are arranged in parallel columns
in the order of their convincingness.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Professor Smith&rsquo;s kindred thesis
offends the facts</span> At a still earlier date&mdash;say <span class=

<p>Some of the sources of Paul approximate in text still more to
Clement&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, the reading <span class="trans" title=
"pon&#275;ria"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&pi;&omicron;&nu;&eta;&rho;&#8055;&#8115;</span></span>
&ldquo;wickedness&rdquo; is not certain. In some,
&ldquo;malignity&rdquo; precedes &ldquo;deceit.&rdquo; In some,
&ldquo;and&rdquo; is added before the words &ldquo;not only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the above parallel passages the agreement both in kind and
sequence of the lists of vices is too close to be accidental; and this
is clinched by the identity of sense and form of the clauses which
follow the two lists. Nor is this the only example of the influence of
the Paulines on Clement. We give one more, giving the English

<p>Here Clement only alludes to Paul&rsquo;s letter, not citing it, and
he betrays a knowledge of the order and times in which Paul wrote his
Epistles; for he declares that 1 Corinthians was written by Paul in the
beginning of the good tidings&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, of his preaching to
them of the Gospel. The Corinthians had been first evangelized by him
three years before. The same phrase meets us in the same sense in Paul
(<a class="biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil%204:15&amp;version=NRSV">Philippians
iv, 15</a>):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that
<i>in the beginning of the Gospel</i>, when I departed from Macedonia,
etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Altogether there are thirty passages in Clement&rsquo;s <i>Epistle
to the Corinthians</i> which indicate more or less clearly a knowledge
of the Pauline Epistles, including that to Hebrews. If we were tracing
the relation of two profane authors, no scholar would hesitate to
acknowledge a direct influence of one on the other. Merely because one
of them happens to belong to the New Testament, such writers as Van
Manen, W. B. Smith, <i lang="la">et hoc genus omne</i>, feel themselves
in duty bound to run their heads against a brick wall. The
responsibility, it must be admitted, lies at the door of orthodox
theologians. For centuries independent scholars have been warned off
the domain of so-called sacred literature. The Bible might not be
treated as any other book. I once heard the late Canon Liddon forecast
the most awful fate for Oxford if it ever should be. The nemesis of
orthodox superstition is that such writers as those we are criticizing
cannot bring themselves to treat the book fairly, as they would other
literature; nor is any hypothesis too crazy for them when they approach
Church history. The laity, in turn, who too often do not know their
right hand <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>from their left, are so justly suspicious of the
evasions and <i lang="fr">arri&egrave;re-pens&eacute;e</i> of orthodox
apologists that they are ready to accept any wild and unscholarly
theory that labels itself Rationalist.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Presuppositions of the argument from
silence</span> The Epistles of Paul, then, must obviously have been
widely known before Marcion issued an expurgated edition of them in the
year 140. We have shown that many of them were familiar to Clement of
Rome in the last decade of the first century. But even if we had no
traces of the Pauline Epistles before the year 140, as Van Manen and
these writers in the teeth of the evidence maintain, it would not
follow that they were as late as the first irrefragable use of them by
a later author. Professor W. B. Smith&rsquo;s argument is based on the
supposed silence of earlier authors, and he entitles his chapter on
this subject &ldquo;<i lang="la">Silentium Saeculi</i>.&rdquo; A
magnificent <i lang="la">petitio principii</i>! He has never thought
over the aptitudes of the &ldquo;argument from silence.&rdquo; This
argument, as MM. Langlois and Seignobos remark in their <i>Introduction
to the Study of History</i> (translation by Berry; London, Duckworth,
1898),</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">is based on the absence of indications with regard to
a fact. From the circumstance of the fact [<i>e.g.</i>, of Paul&rsquo;s
writing certain epistles] not being mentioned in any document it is
inferred that there was no such fact&#8202;&hellip;. It rests on a
feeling which in ordinary life is expressed by saying: &ldquo;If it
were true, we should have heard of it.&rdquo; &hellip; In order that
such reasoning should be justified it would be necessary that every
fact should have been observed and recorded in writing, and that all
the records should have been preserved. Now the greater part of the
documents which have been written have been lost, and the greater part
of the events which happen are not recorded in writing. In the majority
of cases the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>argument would be invalid. It must, therefore,
be restricted to the cases where the conditions implied in it have been
fulfilled. It is necessary not only that there should be now no
documents in existence which mention the fact in question, but that
there should never have been any.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it is notorious that in the case of the earliest Christian
literature there was a special cause at work of a kind to lead to its
disappearance; this was the perpetual alteration of standards of
belief, and the anxiety of rival schools of thought to destroy one
another&rsquo;s books. The philosophic authors above cited further
point out that &ldquo;every manuscript is at the mercy of the least
accident; its preservation or destruction is a matter of pure
chance.&rdquo; In the case of Christian books malice prepense and
<i lang="la">odium theologicum</i> were added to accident and mere
chance.</p>
<p>How, then, can Mr. W. B. Smith be sure that there were not fifty
writings before the year 140 which by citation or otherwise attested
the earlier existence of all or some of the Pauline Epistles? We have
the merest debris of the earliest Christian literature. What right has
he to argue as if he had the whole of it in the hollow of his hand? In
such a context the argument from silence is absolute rubbish, and he
ought to know it. But, alas, the orthodox apologist has trained him in
this sphere to be content with &ldquo;demonstrations&rdquo; which in
any other would be at once extinguished by ridicule.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Date of Paulines to be determined by
contents</span> Obviously the genuineness and date of the Pauline
Epistles can only be determined by their contents, and not by a
supposed deficiency of allusions to them in a literature that is
well-nigh completely lost to us. Judged by these considerations, and by
the hundreds of undesigned coincidences with the Book of Acts, we
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>must conclude in regard to most of them that
they are from the hand of the Paul who is so familiar a figure in that
book. The author of the Paulines has just the same supreme and
exclusive interest in the crucifixion, death, and resurrection of Jesus
the Messiah as the Paul of Acts; he manifests everywhere the same
aloofness from the earthly life and teaching of Jesus. They yield the
same story as does Acts of his birth and upbringing, of his persecution
of the Messianist followers of Jesus and of his conversion; much the
same record of his missionary travels can be reconstructed from the
Letters as we have in Acts. Yet there is no sign of borrowing on either
side. By way of casting doubt on the Pauline Letters the deniers of the
historicity insist on the fact that in Acts there is no hint of Paul
ever having written Epistles to the Churches he created or visited. Why
should there be? <span class="marginnote">Undesigned agreement between
Acts and Paulines</span>To a companion Paul must have been much more
than a mere writer of letters. To Luke the letter writing must have
seemed the least important part of Paul&rsquo;s activity, although for
us the accident of their survival makes the Epistles seem of prime
importance. In the Epistles, on the other hand, it is objected that
there is no indication of any use of Acts. How could there be, seeing
that the book was not penned (except on Van Manen&rsquo;s hypothesis)
until long after the Epistles had been written and sent? I admit that
Paul&rsquo;s account in Galatians of his personal history is difficult
to reconcile with Acts, and has provided a regular crux for critics of
every school.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2941src" href="#xd25e2941"
name="xd25e2941src">1</a> The numerous coincidences, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>however, of the two writings are all the more
worthy of attention. If we found them agreeing pat with each other we
should reasonably suspect some form of common authorship, if not of
collusion. As it is they attest one another very much in the way in
which the letters of Cicero attest and are attested by Sallust, Julius
C&aelig;sar, and other contemporary or later writers of Roman history.
There is neither that complete accord nor complete discord between Acts
and Paulines, which would lead a competent historian to distrust either
as fairly contemporary and trustworthy witnesses to the same epoch and
province of history.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Paul witnesses a real Jesus</span> The
testimony of Paul to a real and historical Jesus is to be gathered from
those passages in which he directly refers to him or in which he refers
to his brethren and disciples, for obviously a solar myth cannot have
had brethren nor have personally commissioned disciples and apostles. I
have pointed out in the first chapter of <i>Myth, Magic, and Morals</i>
that the interest of Paul in the historical Jesus was slender, and have
explained why it was so. But that is no excuse for ignoring it, or
pretending it is not there.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Summary of Pauline evidence</span> What
does it amount to? This, that Jesus the Messiah &ldquo;was born of the
seed of David according to the flesh&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd25e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%201:2&amp;version=NRSV">Rom.
i, 2</a>); that &ldquo;he was born of a woman, born under the

quite independent on the later Gospels; and that proves that even if
the Epistles to Timothy be not Paul&rsquo;s, they are anyhow very early
documents, and constitute another witness to the historicity of Jesus.

2 Cor. xii, 11</a>: &ldquo;In nothing came I behind the very chiefest

<p>From such passages we can realize what a purely Hebrew business the
Church was to begin with. To be an apostle you had to be at least a
Hebrew, and it is clear that the earlier apostles challenged the right
of Paul to call himself an apostle on the ground that he had not, as
they, been a personal follower of Jesus. Their challenge led him to
preface his Epistles with an assertion of his apostleship: &ldquo;Paul,
an apostle of Messiah Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

is referred to as one well known); how he then took bread, and when he
had given thanks, brake it, etc. All this ill agrees with the view that
Paul believed the Jesus of the Gospels to be an ancient Palestinian
Sun-God-Saviour Joshua. We read also (<a class="biblink xd25e45" title=

&ldquo;the rest of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135"
name="pb135">135</a>]</span>the apostles and Cephas,&rdquo; led about
wives (probably spiritual ones), and Paul claims the same right for
himself. In Galatians, ch. ii, he recounts how he went up to Jerusalem
to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days, on which occasion
he associated with James, the brother of the solar myth. On another
occasion this brother of the Sun-god sent emissaries to Antioch to warn
Peter or Cephas against eating with Gentiles, as Paul had taught him to
do. Peter had been &ldquo;intrusted with the gospel of the
circumcision,&rdquo; as Paul with that of the uncircumcision. On this
occasion there was a stand-up quarrel between Paul and the older
apostle of the sun-myth, and Paul&rsquo;s Epistles ring from beginning
to end with echoes of his quarrel over circumcision with the
sun-myth&rsquo;s earlier followers.</p>
<p>How do Mr. Robertson and his friends get round all this evidence?
Their way out of it is beautifully simple. It consists in ruling out
every passage as an interpolation that stands in their way. So I have
seen an ill-tempered chess-player, when he lost his queen, kick over
the chess-table and begin to swear. That is one device. The other is to
pretend that the apostles with whom Paul was in personal touch were not
apostles of the solar god, but of the Jewish high priest, who was also
president of that secret society in whose bosom were acted the ritual
and dramas or mystery-plays<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3044src" href=
"#xd25e3044" name="xd25e3044src">2</a> of annually slain Joshuas, of
vegetation-gods, of Osiris, Krishna, and the whole pack of mythical
beings out of whom the Jewish Messiah Jesus was compacted.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The &ldquo;myth&rdquo; of the Twelve</span>
Let us take first the &ldquo;myth,&rdquo; as Mr. Robertson styles it,
of the Twelve Apostles. Needless to say, Mr. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>Robertson and his friends regard the Gospel
story of their choice and mission as a fable. But they have the bad
grace to turn up afresh in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. Away with them,
therefore, exclaims Mr. Robertson; and his friends echo his cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the documents from which all scientific study of Christian
origins must proceed&mdash;the Epistles of Paul&mdash;there is no
evidence of such a body&rdquo; (<i>Christianity and Mythology</i>, p.
341).</p>
<p>In the passage in which the Twelve are mentioned (<a class=
"biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015:3&amp;version=NRSV">1
Cor. xv, 3</a> foll.) we are further instructed &ldquo;there is one
interpolation on another.&rdquo; It does not in the least matter that
the passage stands in every manuscript, and in every ancient version
and commentator. It offends Mr. Robertson and his friends; so we must
cut it out. <i lang="la">Bos locutus est</i>; and he complacently sums
up his argument (p. 342) in the words: &ldquo;Paul, then, knew nothing
of a &lsquo;twelve.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Difficulties about Judas</span> And yet he
notes (p. 354) that in the fragments of the Peter Gospel recently
recovered from the sands of Egypt, Jesus is still credited with twelve
disciples immediately after the crucifixion, and it is therein related
that they &ldquo;wept and grieved&rdquo; at the loss of their master.
No hint, Mr. Robertson justly remarks, is here given of the defection
of Judas from the group. No more is any hint given of it in
Paul&rsquo;s Epistle. These two sources, therefore, support each other
in a most unexpected manner in ignoring the Judas story. At the same
time <i>twelve</i> disciples or apostles (in the context they are the
same thing) are incredible as an interpolation; for an interpolator
would have adjusted his interpolation to the early diffused story of
Judas&rsquo;s treason, and have written not &ldquo;the Twelve,&rdquo;
but &ldquo;the Eleven.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137"
href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mr. Robertson admits that &ldquo;at the stage of the composition of
this (the Peter) Gospel, the Judas myth was not current,&rdquo; and
that therefore the &ldquo;Judas myth&rdquo; is later than that of the
Twelve. It must, by parity of reasoning, be later than the text of
Paul, which, therefore, if interpolated, must have been interpolated
before the legend, if such it be, of Judas the traitor got abroad. Now
we already meet with this legend in Mark, and it is taken over from him
by the other evangelists, Matthew embellishing it with the tale of
Judas hanging himself, and Luke in Acts with that of his bursting
asunder. Papias, before <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 140, knew of
further details of Judas&rsquo;s story of a most <i>macabre</i> kind;
the story stood also in the lost form of gospel used by Celsus, about
160&ndash;180, against whom Origen wrote. The tale of Judas, then, was
of wide and early diffusion; yet Mr. Robertson, as we have seen, admits
that at the time when the Peter Gospel emerged the Judas myth was not
yet abroad. Neither, then, can it have been current at the stage of the
interpolating of Paul&rsquo;s Epistle, and this interpolation,
therefore, is prior to all the Gospels, to Acts, and to the sources
used by Papias and by the authors of the Peter Gospel and of
Celsus&rsquo;s Gospel. Nevertheless, on p. 357, Mr. Robertson, as a
last method of avoiding Paul&rsquo;s testimony on another point, is
inclined to &ldquo;decide with Van Manen that all the Pauline Epistles
are pseudepigraphic,&rdquo; and merely express the views of
&ldquo;second-century Christian champions.&rdquo; He therefore commits
himself to the supposition that Epistles forged not earlier than
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 130, were yet interpolated in the
interests of a tradition in which &ldquo;the Twelve are treated as
holding together after the resurrection (p. 354),&rdquo; which
tradition, however, must <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href=
"#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>have long before that date been
abrogated by the growing popularity of the Judas myth. Could texts be
treated with greater levity? I may also note that the inconsistency of
Paul&rsquo;s statement that Jesus &ldquo;was seen&rdquo; by the Twelve
with the Judas story was so patent to scribes of the third and fourth
centuries that they had already begun to alter it in the Greek texts
and versions to the statement that &ldquo;he was seen by the
Eleven.&rdquo; Now is it likely that Paul&rsquo;s text at any time
would have been interpolated in such a way as to make it contradict so
early and popular a Christian belief as that in the treason and hurried
suicide of Judas? The hypothesis is absurd, and not the less absurd
because it is framed merely to save the other hypothesis that the
twelve apostles of the Gospels were for the authors of the Gospels and
for their readers an allegory of the twelve signs of the Zodiac
revolving round the solar myth Joshua. Such are the lengths to which
the exigencies of his &ldquo;mythic&rdquo; system drive Mr.
Robertson.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Paul testifies that the older apostles
conversed with Jesus</span> Some texts which imply that Paul, if he did
not actually see Jesus walking about on this earth, yet imply that he
might have done so, he seems to despair of, and passes them over in
silence. Such is the text, <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Cor%205:16&amp;version=NRSV">
2 Cor. v, 16</a>: &ldquo;Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the
flesh: <i>even though we have known Christ</i> after the flesh, yet now
we know him so no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older apostles, as is implied in verse 12 of the same chapter,
prided themselves on their personal intercourse with Jesus, and twitted
Paul with never having enjoyed it. Paul&rsquo;s answer is that
<i>henceforth</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, now that he is converted&mdash;he
has no interest in any man, not even in Jesus, as a being of flesh and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>blood, but only as a vessel filled with the
spirit of election, and so a new creature in Christ, the first member
of the heavenly kingdom on earth. He seems to aver that he had actually
seen his Redeemer in the flesh, but before he was converted. But such
knowledge with him counts nothing in his own favour; nor will he allow
it to count in favour of the older apostles. Their association with
Jesus in the flesh failed to render them apostles in any other sense
than his vision of the risen Jesus rendered him one also.</p>
<p>But there are other texts in Paul most inconvenient to the zodiacal
theory of the apostles. Such are the texts I have cited from Galatians.
How does Mr. Robertson get rid of their evidence?</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Epistle to Galatians attests reality of
Peter, John, and James</span> He begins (p. 342) with the usual
<i>caveat</i> that the Epistle to the Galatians is probably not
genuine, and, even if it be, is nevertheless &ldquo;frequently
interpolated.&rdquo; And yet any reader, with eyes in his head and an
intelligence behind them, must recognize in this Epistle a writing
which, above all other ancient writings, rings true, and is instinct
with the personality of a missionary, who in it bares his inmost heart
to his converts. Against this impression, which it must leave upon
anyone but a pedant, and against the fact that in the external
tradition there is nothing to suggest either that it is not genuine or
that it is a mass of interpolations, what has Mr. Robertson to offer us
in support of his thesis? Nothing, except his <i lang="la">ipse
dixit</i>. We are to accept on a purely philological question the
verdict of one whose mythological equations are on a par with those of
the editors of the <i>Banner of Israel</i>. However, he does condescend
to explain away the apostles with whom, at Jerusalem, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>Paul
held personal converse; and, taking from Professor W. B. Smith a cue,
which is also caught at by Professor Drews, he assures us that the
Peter (<i>or</i> Cephas), James, and John, whom Paul knew personally,
were not men who had been &ldquo;in direct intercourse with
Jesus,&rdquo; but were merely &ldquo;leaders of an existing
sect&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, of the secret sect of Jews who, after
celebrating endless ritual dramas of annually slain Joshuas and
vegetation-gods, had, by dint of prolonged arch&aelig;ological study of
pagan mythology, art, and statuary, elaborated the four Gospels,
adopted the Old Testament as their holy scripture, and Messianic
Judaism as their distinctive creed; for such in essence the
Christianity of the last half of the first century was, as even Mr.
Robertson will hardly deny.</p>
<p>But Paul (<a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal%201:18-19&amp;version=NRSV">Gal.
i, 18, 19</a>) expressly ranks Peter, or Cephas, together with James,
among the apostles, using that word in a wide sense of persons
commissioned by Jesus; and he describes James and Cephas and John
(<a class="biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal%202:9&amp;version=NRSV">ii,
9</a>) as men &ldquo;who were reputed to be pillars,&rdquo; or leading
men of the Church. He declares that in the end they made friends with
him, and arranged that he should preach the Kingdom to the
uncircumcised Gentiles as they were doing to the circumcised Jews.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The &ldquo;Twelve&rdquo; were apostles of
the Jewish High Priest!</span> Now who had commissioned these three
apostles, if not Jesus? Who had taught them about the Kingdom and sent
them forth to proclaim it? Mr. Robertson, oddly enough, scents a
difficulty in the idea of a Sun-God-Saviour Joshua, albeit son of
Miriam a virgin, sending forth apostles; so he decides that
&ldquo;apostles&rdquo; in Galatians means &ldquo;the twelve apostles of
the Patriarch, of whom he must have had knowledge&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>(p.
342). Of what Patriarch? Why, of course, &ldquo;of the Patriarch or
High Priest,&rdquo; whose &ldquo;twelve apostles&rdquo; formed
&ldquo;an institution which preceded and survived the beginning of the
Christian era&rdquo; (p. 344). And, to use Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s own
phrase in such connections, &ldquo;the plot thickens&rdquo; when we
find (<i>ibid.</i>) that</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">the twelve Jewish Apostles aforesaid, who were
commissioned by the High Priest&mdash;and later by the Patriarch at
Tiberias&mdash;to collect tribute from the scattered faithful,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>were no others than the Twelve Apostles who wrote the <span class=
"marginnote">And they wrote the
<i>Didach&eacute;</i>!</span>&ldquo;teaching of the Twelve
Apostles,&rdquo; recovered in 1873 by Bryennios! These &ldquo;Judaizing
apostles preached circumcision,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3163src" href="#xd25e3163" name="xd25e3163src">3</a> and
&ldquo;were among the leaders of the Jesuist community in its
pre-Pauline days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This discovery of Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s is of stupendous interest.
It amounts to nothing less than this: that the pre-Pauline secret sect
of &ldquo;Jesuists&rdquo; which kept up in Jerusalem the cult of the
Sun-God-Saviour Joshua, with his late Persian appendage of a virgin
mother Miriam; and, not content with doing that, padded it out with
ritual dramas of vegetation-gods, cults of Osiris, of Dionysus,
Proteus, Hermes, Janus, and fifty other gods and heroes (whose legends
Mr. Robertson has studied in Smith&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary of
Mythology</i>)&mdash;this sect, I say, had for its president the Jewish
High Priest, and for its &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; the apostles, or
messengers, whom the said High Priest was in the habit of sending out
to the Jews of the Dispersion for the collection of the Temple tribute!
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p>This High Priest, we further learn on p. 342, was the
&ldquo;<i>man</i>&rdquo; who sent out the apostles in the first verse
of Galatians, from which apostles Paul expressly dissociates himself
when he writes: &ldquo;Paul, an apostle, not from men, neither through
a man, but through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Here we are to understand that
Paul is pitting his Sun-God-Saviour Joshua against the Jewish High
Priest. The Sun-god has sent him forth, though not the other apostles.
That must be Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s interpretation, and we must give up
the older and more obvious one which saw in the words &ldquo;not from
men, neither through man,&rdquo; no reference to a Jewish high priest
or priests, but a mere enhancement of the claim, ever reiterated by
Paul, that he owed his apostleship direct to the risen Jesus Christ and
God the Father; so that he held a divine and spiritual, not an earthly
and carnal, commission.</p>
<p>My readers must by now feel very much like poor little Alice when
the Black Queen was dragging her across Wonderland. If they find the
sensation delightful, they can, I daresay, enjoy plenty more of it by a
closer study of Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s books on the subject. If they do
not like it, then they must not blame me for taking him seriously; for
is he not acclaimed by Dr. Drews as our greatest exegete of the New
Testament, Dr. Frazer alone excepted? Is he not the spiritual guide of
learned German orientalists like Winckler and Jensen? Has not Professor
W. B. Smith assured us of how much he feels he can learn from such a
scholar and thinker, though &ldquo;he has preferred not to poach on his
preserves.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3179src" href="#xd25e3179"
name="xd25e3179src">4</a> It is, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143"
href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>therefore, incumbent on me to
probe his work a little further. Let us return to the passage,
<a class="biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015:5&amp;version=NRSV">
1 Cor. xv, 5</a>, where we are told that Jesus appeared first to
Cephas. We have already seen that the Peter of the Gospels is in this
new system alternately a sign of the Zodiac, a Mithraic myth, an alias
of Janus, of Proteus, a member of any other Pantheon you like.
Obviously he has nothing to do with Paul&rsquo;s acquaintance. The
latter in turn is &ldquo;not one of the pupils and companions of the
crucified Jesus&rdquo; (p. 348). How, indeed, could he be, seeing that
Jesus is a Sun-god crucified upon the Milky Way? No, he is something
much humbler&mdash;to wit, &ldquo;simply one of the apostles of a
Judaic cult that preaches circumcision,&rdquo; and, more definitely, as
we have seen, one of the twelve apostles of the Jewish High Priest.
James and John must equally have belonged to this interesting band of
apostles.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Jesus of Nazareth was Jesus Ben
Pandira,</span> This being so, it is pertinent to ask why Paul so
persistently indicates that these apostles and pillars of the Church
had seen Jesus and conversed with him in the flesh. To this question
Mr. Robertson attempts no answer. For he believes that the crucified
Jesus, to whom Paul refers on every page of his Epistles, was not the
Jesus of Christian tradition, but &ldquo;Jesus Ben Pandira, dead long
before, and represented by no preserved biography or teachings
whatever&rdquo; (p. 378). This Jesus had &ldquo;really been only hanged
on a tree&rdquo; (<i>ibid.</i>); but &ldquo;the factors of a
crucifixion myth,&rdquo; among which we must not forget its
&ldquo;phallic significance,&rdquo; for that &ldquo;should connect with
all its other aspects&rdquo; (p. 375),&mdash;these factors, says Mr.
Robertson, &ldquo;were conceivably strong enough to turn the hanging
into a crucifixion.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href=
"#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">who had died one hundred years
before</span> It follows that Paul was quite mistaken in indicating the
apostles whom he conversed with at Jerusalem to be apostles of the
crucified one; in order to be so, they must all have been over-ripe
centenarians, since Pandira had died at least a hundred years before.
It matters nothing that on the next page (379) Mr. Robertson entertains
doubts as to whether this worthy ever lived at all. Who else, he asks
(p. 364), could &ldquo;the Pauline Jesus, who has taught nothing and
done nothing,&rdquo; be, save &ldquo;a doctrinal evolution from the
Jesus of a hundred years before?&rdquo; We must, he adds with
delightful <i lang="la">ignoratio elenchi</i>, &ldquo;perforce assume
such a long evolution.&rdquo; Otherwise it would not be
&ldquo;intelligible that, even if he had been only hanged after
stoning, he should by that time have come to figure mythically as
crucified.&rdquo; He admits that Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;references to a
crucified Jesus are constant, and offer no sign of
interpolation.&rdquo; And he is quite ready to admit also that,
&ldquo;if the Jesus of Paul were really a personage put to death under
Pontius Pilate, the Epistles (of Paul) would give us the strongest
ground for accepting an actual crucifixion.&rdquo; But, alas, the Jesus
put to death under Pontius Pilate, the Javelin-man, is no more than an
allegory of Joshua the ancient Palestinian Sun-god, rolled up with a
vegetation-god and other mythical beings, and slain afresh once a year.
There is thus no alternative left but to identify Paul&rsquo;s
crucified Jesus with Jesus Ben Pandira; and Mr. Robertson, with a sigh
of relief, embraces the alternative, for he feels that Paul&rsquo;s
evidence is menacing his whole structure.</p>
<p>It was nasty of Paul not to indicate more clearly to us that by his
crucified Jesus he intended Jesus Ben Pandira; and, in view of the
circumstance that we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145"
name="pb145">145</a>]</span>have left to us no &ldquo;biography or
teachings whatever&rdquo; of this Jesus, Paul might surely have
communicated to us some details of his career. It would have saved Mr.
Robertson the trouble of inventing them.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">James, brother of Jesus, only in a
Pickwickian sense</span> At first sight, too, it was extremely
inconsiderate of Paul to &ldquo;thicken the plot&rdquo; by bringing on
his stage a brother of Jesus Ben Pandira or of the solar myth Joshua. I
am not sure which. But Mr. Robertson, like Alice, is out for strange
adventures, and prepared to face any emergency. &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo;
therefore, is here to be taken in a Pickwickian sense only. And here we
will let Dr. W. B. Smith take up the parable, for it is he who has,
with the help of St. Jerome, found his friends a way out of their
difficulty. Moreover, he is more in need of a way out than even Mr.
Robertson; for he declines to admit behind Jesus of Nazareth
even&mdash;what Mr. Robertson styles, p. 364&mdash;&ldquo;a Talmudic
trace of <i>a</i> Jesus (Ben Pandira), who was put to death on the eve
of the Passover about a century before the time of Pontius
Pilate.&rdquo; Professor Smith cannot hesitate, therefore, to be of
opinion that, when Paul calls James a brother of the Lord, he does not
&ldquo;imply any family kinship,&rdquo; but one of a &ldquo;class of
earnest Messianists, zealots of obedience&rdquo; to the Mosaic Law. He
appeals in confirmation of his conjecture to the apostrophe of Jesus
when his mother and brethren came to arrest him as an ecstatic

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Who is my mother and my brethren? &hellip; whosoever
shall do the will of God, the same is my brother and sister and

<p>He also appeals to <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%209:5&amp;version=NRSV">
1 Cor. ix, 5</a>, where Paul alludes to &ldquo;the brethren of the
Lord&rdquo; as claiming a right to lead about a wife that is a sister.
And he argues that those who in Corinth, to the imperilling of
Christian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=

others, &ldquo;I am of Christ&rdquo;; others, &ldquo;I am of
Apollos,&rdquo; were known as brethren of Christ, of Cephas, etc. Now
it is true that Paul and other early Christian writers regarded the
members of the Church as <i>brethren</i> or as <i>sisters</i>, just as
the members of monastic society have ever styled themselves
<i>brothers</i> and <i>sisters</i> of one another. But there is no
example of a believer being called a brother <i>of the Lord</i> or
<i>of Jesus</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3248src" href="#xd25e3248"
name="xd25e3248src">5</a> The passage in Mark and its parallels are,
according to Professor Smith, purely legendary and allegorical, since
he denies that Jesus ever lived; and he has no right, therefore, to
appeal to them in order to decide what Paul intended by the phrase when
he used it, as before, not of a mythical, but of a concrete, case.
However, if Professor Smith is intent on appealing to the Gospels, then
he must allow equal weight to such a text as <a class="biblink xd25e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2013:55&amp;version=NRSV">
Matthew xiii, 55</a>: &ldquo;Is not this the carpenter&rsquo;s son? Is
not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James and Joseph and
Simon and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did all these people, we may ask, including his mother, stand in a
merely spiritual relationship to Jesus? Impossible. If they were not
flesh and blood relations, then the passage is meaningless even as
allegorical romance. Again, in the very passage to which Professor
Smith appeals (<a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%203:31-35&amp;version=NRSV">Mark
iii, 31&ndash;35</a>), we read that his <i>mother and brethren</i> came
and stood without, and it was their interference with him that provoked
the famous apostrophe. Were they, too, only spiritually related to him?
Were they, too, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147"
name="pb147">147</a>]</span>&ldquo;earnest Messianists, zealots of
obedience&rdquo;? In John&rsquo;s Gospel we hear afresh that his
brethren believed not in him. Were they, too, mere &ldquo;earnest
Messianists, zealots of obedience&rdquo;? When Josephus, again, <a id=
"xd25e3268" name="xd25e3268"></a>alludes to &ldquo;James the Just who
was brother of Jesus,&rdquo; is he, an enemy of the Christian faith,
adopting Christian slang? Does he, too, mean merely to &ldquo;denote
religious relation without the remotest hint of blood kinship&rdquo;?

<p><span class="marginnote">Both in Paul and in the Gospels the

then, are four wholly independent groups of ancient documents, of which
one gives us the names of four of the brothers of Jesus, clearly
indicating that they were real brothers, and sons of Mary and the
Carpenter; while the other group (the Paulines) speak as ever of his
&ldquo;brothers,&rdquo; but give us the name of one only, James; the
third&mdash;viz., the works of Josephus&mdash;allude to one
only&mdash;viz., James, but without indicating that there were not

James.&rdquo; Is not this enough? Surely, if we were here treating of
profane history, no sane student would for a moment hesitate to accept
such data, furnished by wholly independent and coincident documents, as
historical. Professor Smith&rsquo;s other guess, that in <a class=

title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%201:12&amp;version=NRSV">
1 Cor. i, 12</a> foll., is absurd; for Paul is alluding there to
factions among the believers of Corinth; how is it possible to
interpret these factions as brotherhoods? There was only one
brotherhood of the faithful, according to Paul&rsquo;s ideal; and the
relationship involved in such phrases as &ldquo;I of Cephas,&rdquo;
&ldquo;I of Paul,&rdquo; is that of a convert to his teacher and
evangelist, not that of spiritual brethren to each other. As used by
his Corinthian converts, such phrases were a direct menace to spiritual
brotherhood and unity, and not an expression of it; and that is why
Paul wished to hear no more of them. When he makes appeal to them
Professor Smith damages rather than benefits his argument.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Jerome&rsquo;s opinion about Jesus&rsquo;s
brothers</span> There remains the appeal to Jerome (<i lang="la">Ecce
Deus</i>, p. 237):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">No less an authority than Jerome has expressed the
correct idea on this point. In commenting on <a class="biblink xd25e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal%201:19&amp;version=NRSV">
Gal. i, 19</a>, he says (in sum): &ldquo;James was called the
Lord&rsquo;s brother on account of his high character, his incomparable
faith, and his extraordinary wisdom; the other apostles are also called
brothers&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2020:17&amp;version=NRSV">John
xx, 17</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Professor Smith withholds from his readers the fact that Jerome
regarded James the brother of Jesus as his first cousin. It is just as
difficult for a mythical personage to have a first cousin as to have a
brother. Moreover, the reasons which actuated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>Jerome to deny that Jesus had real brethren
was&mdash;as the <i lang="la">Encyclop&aelig;dia Biblica</i> (art.
James) points out&mdash;&ldquo;a prepossession in favour of the
perpetual virginity of Mary the mother of Jesus.&rdquo; It is, indeed,
a hollow theory that, in order to its justification, must take refuge
in the Encratite rubbish of Jerome.</p>

Cor. xv, 6</a>) that the greater part of the 500 brethren to whom Jesus
appeared were still alive? I neither assert nor deny the possibility of
so many at once having fallen under the spell of a common illusion,
though I believe the annals of religious ecstasy might afford
parallels. But this I do maintain, that the passage records a
conviction in Paul&rsquo;s mind that Jesus, after his death by
crucifixion, had appeared to many at once, and that not a hundred years
before, but at a comparatively recent time. That is also Mr.
Robertson&rsquo;s view; for, rather than face the passage, he whips out
his knife and cuts it out of the text. Yet there is not a single reason
for doing so, except that it upsets his hypothesis; for the
circumstance that the incident cannot be reconciled with the Gospel
stories of the apparitions of the risen Christ clearly shows that
Paul&rsquo;s text is independent on them. Mr. Robertson argues that, if
it were not a late interpolation, the evangelists would have found it
in Paul and incorporated it in their Gospels. I ask in turn,
<span class="corr" id="xd25e3348" title="Source: Why">why</span> did
the interpolator thrust into the Pauline letter not only this passage,
but at least two other incidents (the apparitions to Peter and James)
which figure in no canonical Gospel? Why, if the Evangelists were bound
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>consult the Paulines in giving an account of
these posthumous appearances, was not the hypothetical interpolator of
the Paulines equally bound to consult them? The most natural hypothesis
is that the Gospels on one side and the Pauline Epistles on the other
led independent lives, till their respective traditions were so firmly
fixed that no one could tamper with either of them. The conflict,
therefore, such as it is, between this Pauline passage and the Gospels
is the strongest possible proof of its genuineness.</p>

1 Cor. xi, 23&ndash;27</a>, is another example of his determination
simply to rule out all evidence which he cannot explain away.
&ldquo;<i>It is evident</i>,&rdquo; he writes (p. 347), that this whole
passage, &ldquo;or at least the first part of it, is an
interpolation.&rdquo; We would expect him to produce support for this
view from some MS. or ancient version for what is so <i>evident</i>.
Not at all; for he takes no interest in, and has no turn for, the
scientific criticism of texts <i>a posteriori</i>, but deals with them
by <i>a priori</i> intuitions of his own. &ldquo;The passage in
question (verses 23, 24, 25) has every appearance of being an
interpolation.&rdquo; He is the first to discover such an appearance.
It is well known that the words &ldquo;took bread&rdquo; as far as
&ldquo;in my blood&rdquo; recur in <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2022:19-20&amp;version=NRSV">
Luke xxii, 19, 20</a>; and this is how Mr. Robertson deals with the
problem of their recurrence: &ldquo;No one pretends that the Third
Gospel was in existence in Paul&rsquo;s time; and the only question is
whether Luke copied the Epistle or a late copyist supplemented the
Epistle from Luke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely there is another alternative&mdash;viz., that a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>copyist of Luke supplemented the Gospel from
Paul. This is as conceivable as that a copyist of Paul supplemented the
Epistle from Luke. It is also an hypothesis that has textual evidence
in favour of it; for the Bezan Codex and several old Latin MSS., as
well as the old Syriac version, omit the words, <i>which is given on
your behalf</i>, as far as <i>on your behalf is shed</i>&mdash;that is
to say, the end of verse 19 and the whole of verse 20. <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e3386" title="Added by author">But, since the Bezan
omission does not cover the whole of the matter taken from Corinthians,
we may suppose that Luke borrowed the words from the Epistle in

and ignorance with which Mr. Robertson applies his principle of
&ldquo;vital interpolations&rdquo; to remove anything from the New
Testament texts which stands in the way of his far-fetched hypotheses
and artificial combinations.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Jesus Ben Pandira in Talmud <i>is</i> Jesus
of Nazareth</span> But it is time to inquire whence Mr. Robertson
derived his certainty that Jesus Ben Pandira died in the reign of
Alexander Jannaeus, <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 106&ndash;79. Dr.
Samuel Kraus, in his exhaustive study of Talmudic notices of Jesus of
Nazareth (<i lang="de">Das Leben Jesu nach j&uuml;dischen Quellen</i>,
Berlin, 1902, p. 242) assumes as a fact beyond dispute that the Jeschu
or Joshua Ben Pandira (or Ben Stada or Ben Satda) mentioned in the
<i>Toldoth Jeschu</i> is Jesus of Nazareth. In the Toldoth he is set in
the reign of Tiberius. This Toldoth is not earlier than <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 400, and took its information from the
pseudo-Hegesippus. The Spanish historian Abraham b. Da&ucirc;d (about
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1100) already noticed that the Talmudic
tradition alluded to by Mr. Robertson set the birth of Jesus of
Nazareth a hundred years too early; but the same tradition corrects
itself in that it assigns Salome Alexandra to Alexander Jannai as his
wife, and then, confusing her with Queen Helena the proselyte, brings
the incident down to the right date. &ldquo;The truth is,&rdquo; says
Dr. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=

"Source: Horae Hebraicae">Hor&aelig; Hebraic&aelig;</span></i> Mr.
Robertson refers in his footnote (p. 363), also assumed that by Jesus
Ben Pandira, or son of Panthera, the Talmudists intended Jesus of
Nazareth. Celsus (about <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 170) attested a
Jewish tradition that Jesus Christ was Mary&rsquo;s son by a Roman
soldier named Panthera, and later on even Christian writers worked
Panthera into Mary&rsquo;s pedigree. Such is the origin of the Talmudic
tradition exploited by Mr. Robertson. It is almost worthless; but, so
far as it goes, it overthrows Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s hypothesis.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The disputed Epistles of Paul so many fresh

It remains to examine how this school of writers handle the evidence
with regard to the earliest church supplied by Jewish or Pagan writers.
I have said enough incidentally of the evidence of the Talmud and
Toldoth Jeschu, but there remains that of Josephus. In the work on the
<i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, Bk. xviii, 5, 2 (116 foll.), there is
an account of John the Baptist, and it is narrated that Herod, fearing
an insurrection of John&rsquo;s followers, threw him in bonds into the
castle of Machaerus, and there murdered him. Afterwards, when
Herod&rsquo;s army was destroyed, the Jewish population attributed the
disaster to the wrath of God, and saw in it a retribution for slaying
so just a man.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3508src" href="#xd25e3508"

Synoptic Gospels, except that in the Gospels the place and
circumstances of his murder are differently given. This difference is
good evidence that Josephus&rsquo;s account is independent of the
Christian sources. Nevertheless, Dr. Drews airily pretends that there
is a strong suspicion of its being a forgery by some Christian hand. As
for John the Baptist as we meet him in the Gospels, he is, says Drews,
no historical personage. One expects some reason to be given for this
negative conclusion, but gets none whatever except a magnificent hint
that &ldquo;a complete understanding of the baptism in the Jordan can
only be attained, if here, too, we take into consideration the
translation of the baptism into astrological terms&rdquo; (<i>Christ
Myth</i>, p. 121).</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The astral John Baptist</span> And he
proceeds to dilate on the thesis that the baptism of Jesus in the
Jordan was &ldquo;the reflection upon earth of what originally took
place among the stars.&rdquo; This discovery rests on an
equation&mdash;pre-philological, of course, like that of
&ldquo;Maria&rdquo; with &ldquo;Myrrha&rdquo;&mdash;of the name
&ldquo;John&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehohanan&rdquo; with &ldquo;Oannes&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Ea,&rdquo; the Babylonian Water-god. However, this writer is
here not a little incoherent, for only on the page before he has
assured us, as of something unquestionable, that John was closely
related to the Essenes, and baptized the penitents in the Jordan in the
open air. Was Jordan, too, up in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156"
href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>heaven? Were the Essenes
there also? Mr. Robertson, of course, pursues the same simple method of
disposing of adverse evidence, and asserts (p. 396) that
Josephus&rsquo;s account of John &ldquo;is plainly open to that
suspicion of interpolation which, in the case of the allusion to Jesus
in the same book (<i>Antiq.</i>, xviii, 3, 3), has become for most
critics a certainty.&rdquo; He does not condescend to inform his
readers that the latter passage<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3527src"
href="#xd25e3527" name="xd25e3527src">2</a> is absent from important
MSS., was unknown to Origen, and is therefore rightly bracketed by
editors; whereas the account of John is in all MSS., and was known to
Origen. But as we have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href=
"#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>seen before, Mr. Robertson is one
of those gifted people who can discern by peculiar intuitions of their
own that everything is interpolated in an author which offends their
prejudices. He has a lofty contempt for the careful sifting of the
textual tradition, the examination of MSS. and ancient versions to
which a scholar resorts, before he condemns a passage of an ancient
author as an interpolation. Moreover, a scholar feels himself bound to
show why a passage was interpolated, in whose interests. For, regarded
as an interpolation, a passage is as much a problem to him as it was
before. Its genesis has still to be explained. But Messrs. Robertson
and Drews and Smith do not condescend to explain anything or give any
reasons. A passage slays their theories; therefore it is a &ldquo;vital
interpolation.&rdquo; It is the work of an ancient enemy sowing tares
amid their wheat.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Josephus&rsquo;s reference to James,
brother of Jesus</span> John the Baptist having been removed in this
cavalier fashion from the pages of Josephus, we can hardly expect James
the brother of Jesus to be left, and he is accordingly kicked out
without ceremony. It does not matter a scrap that the passage
(<i>Antiquities</i> xx, 9, 1, 200) stands in the Greek MSS. and in the
Latin Version. As Professor W. B. Smith&rsquo;s argument on the point
is representative of this class of critics, we must let him speak first
(p. 235):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Origen <i>thrice</i> quotes as from Josephus the
statement that the Jewish sufferings at the hands of Titus were a
divine retribution for the slaying of James.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then proceeds to quote the text of Origen, <i>Against Celsus</i>,
i, 47, giving the reference, but mangling in the most extraordinary
manner a text that is clear and consecutive. For Origen begins
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>(ch. xlvii) by saying that Celsus &ldquo;somehow
accepted John as a Baptist who baptized Jesus,&rdquo; and then adds the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">In the Eighteenth Book of his <i>Antiquities of the
Jews</i> Josephus bears witness to John as having been a Baptist, and
as promising purification to those who underwent the rite. Now this
writer, although not believing in Jesus as the Christ, in seeking after
the cause of the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple,
whereas he ought to have said that the conspiracy against Jesus was the
cause of these calamities befalling the people since they put to death
Christ, who was a prophet, says, nevertheless&mdash;although against
his will, not far from the truth&mdash;that these disasters happened to
the Jews as a punishment for the death of James the Just, who was a
brother of Jesus called Christ, the Jews having put him to death,
although he was a man most distinguished for his righteousness
(<i>i.e.</i>, strict observance of the law).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a later passage of the same treatise (ii, 13), which Mr. Smith
cites correctly, Origen refers again to the same passage of the
<i>Antiquities</i> (xx, 200) thus: &ldquo;Titus demolished Jerusalem,
as Josephus writes, on account of James the Just, the brother of Jesus,
the so-called Christ.&rdquo; Also in Origen&rsquo;s commentary on
<a class="biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2013:55&amp;version=NRSV">
Matthew xiii, 55</a>, we have a like statement that the sufferings of
the Jews were a punishment for the murder of James the Just.</p>
<p>Origen therefore cites Josephus thrice about James, and in each case
he has in mind the same passage&mdash;viz., xx, 200. But Mr. Smith,
after citing the shorter passage, <i lang="la">Contra Celsum</i>, ii,
13, goes on as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The passage is still found in some Josephus
manuscripts; but, as it is wanting in others, it is, and must be,
regarded as a Christian interpolation older than Origen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<p>Will Mr. Smith kindly tell us which are the MSS. in which are found
any passage or passages referring the fall of Jerusalem to the death of
James, and so far contradicting Josephus&rsquo;s interpretation of
Ananus&rsquo;s death in the <i>History of the Jewish War</i>, iv, 5, 2.
Niese, the latest editor, knows of none, nor did any previous editor
know of any.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith then proceeds thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Now, since this phrase is certainly interpolated in
the one place, the only reasonable conclusion is that it is
interpolated in the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But &ldquo;this phrase&rdquo; never stood in Josephus at all, even
as an interpolation, and on examination it turns out that Professor
Smith&rsquo;s prejudice against the passage in which Josephus mentions
James, is merely based on the muddle committed by Origen. Such are the
arguments by which he seeks to prove that Josephus&rsquo;s text was
interpolated by a Christian, as if a Christian interpolator, supposing
there had been one (and he has left no trace of himself), would not, as
the protest of Origen sufficiently indicates, have represented the fall
of Jerusalem as a divine punishment, not for the slaying of James, but
for the slaying of Jesus. Having demolished the evidence of Josephus in
such a manner, Mr. Smith heads ten of his pages with the words,
&ldquo;<i>The Silence of Josephus</i>,&rdquo; as if he had settled all
doubts for ever by mere force of his erroneous <i lang="la">ipse
dixit</i>.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The testimony of Tacitus</span> The next
section of Professor Smith&rsquo;s work (<i lang="la">Ecce Deus</i>) is
headed with the same effrontery of calm assertion: &ldquo;<i>The
Silence of Tacitus</i>.&rdquo; This historian relates (<i>Annals</i>,
xv, 44) that Nero accused the Christians of having burned down Rome.
Nero <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">subjected to most exquisite tortures those whom, hated
for their crimes, the populace called Chrestians. The author of this
name, Christus, had been executed in the reign of Tiberius by the
Procurator Pontius Pilate; and, though repressed for the moment, the
pernicious superstition was breaking forth again, not only throughout
Jud&aelig;a, the fountain-head of this mischief, but also throughout
the capital, where all things from anywhere that are horrible or
disgraceful pour in together and are made a religion of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the sequel Tacitus describes how an immense multitude, less for
the crime of incendiarism than in punishment of their hatred of
humanity, were convicted; how some were clothed in skins of wild beasts
and thrown to dogs, while others were crucified or burned alive.
Nero&rsquo;s savagery was such that it awoke the pity even of a Roman
crowd for his victims.</p>
<p>Such a passage as the above, written by Tacitus soon after
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 100, is somewhat disconcerting to our
authors. Professor Smith, proceeding on his usual innocent assumption
that the whole of the ancient literature, Christian and profane, of
this epoch lies before him, instead of a scanty d&eacute;bris of it,
votes it to be a forgery. Why? Because Melito, Bishop of Sardis about
170 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>, is the first writer who alludes to it
in a fragment of an apology addressed to a Roman Emperor. As if there
were not five hundred striking episodes narrated by Tacitus, yet never
mentioned by any subsequent writer at all. Would Mr. Smith on that
account dispute their authenticity? It is only because this episode
concerns Christianity and gets in the way of his theories, that he
finds it necessary to cut it out of the text. You can prove anything if
you cook your evidence, and the wanton <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>mutilation of texts
which no critical historian has ever called in question is a flagrant
form of such cookery. In the hands of these writers facts are made to
fit theory, not theory to fit facts.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Testimony of Clement agrees with
Tacitus</span> I hardly need add that the narrative of Tacitus is
frank, straightforward, and in keeping with all we know or can infer in
regard to Christianity in that epoch. Mr. E. G. Hardy, in his valuable
book <i>Christianity and the Roman Government</i> (London, 1894, p.
70), has pointed out that &ldquo;the mode of punishment was that
prescribed for those convicted of magic,&rdquo; and that Suetonius uses
the term <i>malefica</i> of the new religion&mdash;a term which has
this special sense. Magicians, moreover, in the code of Justinian,
which here as often reflects a much earlier age, are declared to be
&ldquo;enemies of the human race.&rdquo; Nor is it true that
Nero&rsquo;s persecution as recorded in Tacitus is mentioned by no
writer before Melito. It is practically certain that Clement, writing
about <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 95, refers to it. He records that a
<span class="trans" title="poly pl&#275;thos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&#8058;
&pi;&lambda;&#8134;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>, or vast
multitude of Christians, the <i lang="la">ingens multitudo</i> of
Tacitus, perished in connection with the martyrdom of Peter and Paul.
He speaks of the manifold insults and torments of men, the terrible and
unholy outrages upon women, in terms that answer exactly to the two
phrases of Tacitus: <i lang="la">pereuntibus addita ludibria</i> and
<i lang="la">quaesitissimae poenae</i>. Women, he implies, were,
&ldquo;like Dirce, fastened on the horns of bulls, or, after figuring
as Danaides in the arena, were exposed to the attacks of wild
beasts&rdquo; (Hardy, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 72). <span class=
"marginnote">Drews on Poggio&rsquo;s interpolations of
Tacitus</span>However, Drews is not content with merely ousting the
passage from Tacitus, but undertakes to explain to his readers how it
got there. It was, he conjectures, made up out of a similar passage
read in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>Chronicle of Sulpicius Severus (written about
407) by some clever forger, probably Poggio, who smuggled it into the
text of Tacitus, &ldquo;a writer whose text is full of
interpolations.&rdquo; It is hardly necessary to inform an educated
reader, firstly, that the text of Tacitus is recognized by all
competent Latin scholars to be remarkably free from interpolations;
secondly, that Severus merely abridged his account of Nero&rsquo;s
persecution from the narrative he found in Tacitus, an author whom he
frequently copied and imitated; thirdly, that Poggio, the supposed
interpolator, lived in the fifteenth century, whereas our oldest MS. of
this part of Tacitus is of the eleventh century; it is now in the
Laurentian Library. I should advise Dr. Drews to stick to his
javelin-man story, and not to venture on incursions into the field of
classical philology.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Pliny&rsquo;s letter to Trajan</span>
Having dispatched Josephus and Tacitus, and printed over their pages in
capitals the titles <i>The Silence of Josephus</i> and <i>The Silence
of Tacitus</i>, these authors, needless to say, have no difficulty with
Pliny and Suetonius. The former, in his letter (No. 96) to Trajan,
gives some particulars of the Christians of Bithynia, probably obtained
from renegades. They asserted that the gist of their offence or error
was that they were accustomed on a regularly recurring day to meet
before dawn, and repeat in alternating chant among themselves a hymn to
Christ as to a God; they also bound themselves by a holy oath not to
commit any crime, neither theft, nor brigandage, nor adultery, and not
to betray their word or deny a deposit when it was demanded. After this
rite was over they had had the custom to break up their meeting, and to
come together afresh later in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163"
href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>day to partake of a meal,
which, however, was of an ordinary and innocent kind.</p>
<p>In this repast we recognize the early eucharist at which Christians
were commonly accused of devouring human flesh, as the Jews are accused
by besotted fanatics of doing in Russia to-day, and by Mr. Robertson in
ancient Jerusalem. Hence Pliny&rsquo;s proviso that the food they
partook of was ordinary and innocent. The passage also shows that this
eucharistic meal was not the earliest rite of the day, like the fasting
communion of the modern Ritualist, but was held later in the day.
Lastly, the qualification that they sang hymns to Christ <i>as to a
God</i>, though to Pliny it conveyed no more than the phrase &ldquo;as
if to Apollo,&rdquo; or &ldquo;as if to Aesculapius,&rdquo; clearly
signifies that the person so honoured was or had been a human being.
Had he been a Sun-god Saviour, the phrase would be hopelessly inept.
This letter and Trajan&rsquo;s answer to it were penned about 110
<span class="sc">A.D.</span></p>
<p>Of this letter Professor W. B. Smith writes (p. 252) that in it
&ldquo;there is no implication, not even the slightest, touching the
purely human reality of the Christ or Jesus.&rdquo; Let us suppose the
letter had referred to the cult of Augustus C&aelig;sar, and that we
read in it of people who, by way of honouring his memory, met on
certain days and sang a hymn to Augustus <i>quasi deo</i>, &ldquo;as to
a God.&rdquo; We know that the members of a <i>college of Augustals</i>
did so meet in most cities of the Roman Empire. Well, would Mr. Smith
contend in such a case that the letter carried no implication, not even
the slightest, touching the purely human reality of the Augustus or
C&aelig;sar? Of course he would not. If this letter were the sole
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>record in existence of early Christianity, we
might perhaps hesitate about its implications; but it is in the
characteristic Latin which no one, so far as we know, ever wrote,
except the younger Pliny, and is accompanied by Trajan&rsquo;s answer,
couched in an equally characteristic style. It is, moreover, but one
link in a long chain, which as a whole attests and presupposes the
reality of Jesus. Mr. Smith, however, does not seem quite sure of his
ground, for in the next sentence he hints that after all Pliny&rsquo;s
letter is not genuine. These writers are not the first to whom this
letter has proved a <i lang="la">pons asinorum</i>. Semler began the
attack on its genuineness in 1784; and others, who desired to eliminate
all references to Christianity in early heathen writers, have, as J. B.
Lightfoot has remarked (<i>Apostolic Fathers</i>, Pt. II, vol. i, p.
55), followed in his wake. Their objections do not merit serious
refutation.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Evidence of Suetonius</span> There remains
Suetonius, who in ch. xxv of his life of Claudius speaks of Messianic
disturbances at Rome <i lang="la">impulsore Chresto</i>. Claudius
reigned from 41&ndash;54, and the passage may possibly be an echo of
the conflict, clearly delineated in Acts and Paulines between the Jews
and the followers of the new Messiah.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3741src" href="#xd25e3741" name="xd25e3741src">3</a> Itacism or
interchange of &ldquo;<i>e</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>i</i>&rdquo; being
the commonest of corruptions in Greek and Latin MSS., we may fairly
conjecture <i>Christo</i> in the source used by Suetonius, who wrote
about the year 120. <i>Christo</i>, which means Messiah, is
intelligible in relation to Jews, but not <i>Chresto</i>; and the two
words were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>identical in pronunciation. Drews of course
upholds <i>Chresto</i>, and in Tacitus would substitute for Christiani
<i>Chrestiani</i>; for this there is indeed manuscript support, but it
is gratuitous to argue as he does that the allusion is to Serapis or
Osiris, who were called Chrestos &ldquo;the good&rdquo; by their
votaries. He does not condescend to adduce any evidence to show that in
that age or any other <i>Chrestos</i>, used absolutely, signified
<i>Osiris or Serapis</i>; and there is no reason to suppose it ever had
such a significance. He is on still more precarious ground when he
surmises that Nero&rsquo;s victims at Rome were not followers of
Christ, but of Serapis, and were called <i>Chrestiani</i> by the mob
ironically, because of their vices. Here we begin to suspect that he is
joking. Why should worshippers of Serapis have been regarded as
specially vicious by the Roman mob? Jews and Christians were no doubt
detested, because they could not join in any popular festivities or
thanksgivings. But there was nothing to prevent votaries of Serapis or
Osiris from doing so, nor is there any record of their being unpopular
as a class.</p>
<p>In his life of Nero, Suetonius, amid a number of brief notices,
apparently taken from some annalistic work, includes the following:
&ldquo;The Christians were visited with condign punishments&mdash;a
race of men professing a new and <i>malefic</i> superstition.&rdquo; On
this passage I have commented above (p. 161).</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Origin of the name
&ldquo;Christian&rdquo;</span> Characteristically enough, Dr. Drews
assumes, without a shadow of argument, that the famous text in Acts
which says that the followers of Jesus were first called Christians in
Antioch is an interpolation. It stands in the way of his new thesis
that the Roman people called the followers of Serapis&mdash;who was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span><i>Chrestos</i> or
&ldquo;good&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Chrestiani</i>, because they were precisely
the contrary.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3800src" href="#xd25e3800"
name="xd25e3800src">4</a> Tacitus does not say that Nero&rsquo;s
victims were so called <i>because</i> of their vices. That is a gloss
put on the text by Drews. We only learn (<i>a</i>) that they were hated
by the mob for their vices, and (<i>b</i>) that the mob at that time
called them Chrestiani. His use of the imperfect tense <i lang=
"la">appellabat</i> indicates that in his own day the same sect had
come to be known under their proper appellation as Christiani. In
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 64, he implies, a Roman mob knew no

passage in which Josephus mentions John the Baptist runs as follows:
&ldquo;To some of the Jews it seemed that Herod had had his army
destroyed by God, and that it was a just retribution on him for his
severity towards John called the Baptist. For it was indeed Herod who
slew him, though a good man, and one who bade the Jews in the practise
of virtue and in the use of justice one to another and of piety towards
God to walk together in baptism. For this was the condition under which
baptism would present itself to God as acceptable, if they availed
themselves of it, not by way of winning pardon for certain sins, but
after attaining personal holiness, on account of the soul having been
cleansed beforehand by righteousness. Because men flocked to him, for
they took the greatest pleasure in listening to his words, Herod took
fright and apprehended that his vast influence over people would lead
to some outbreak of rebellion. For it looked as if they would follow
his advice in all they did, and he came to the conclusion that far the
best course was, before any revolution was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155n" href="#pb155n" name=
"pb155n">155</a>]</span>started by him, to anticipate it by destroying
him: otherwise the upheaval would come, and plunge him into trouble and
remorse. So John fell a victim to Herod&rsquo;s suspicions, was bound
and sent to the fortress of Machaerus, of which I have above spoken,
and there murdered. But the Jews were convinced that the loss of his
army was by way of retribution for the treatment of John, and that it
was God who willed the undoing of Herod.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

<i>Ant.</i> xviii, 3, 3: &ldquo;<i>Now about this time came Jesus</i>,
a wise man, if indeed one may call him a man, for he was a doer of
wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive what is true with
pleasure, and he attracted many Jews and many of the Greeks. <i>This
was the &lsquo;Christ.&rsquo; And when on the accusation of the
principal men amongst us Pilate had condemned him to the cross, they
did not desist who had formerly loved him</i>, for he appeared to them
on the third day alive again; the divine Prophets having foretold both
this and a myriad other wonderful things about him; <i>and even now the

out</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">I have italicized such clauses as have a

Testament), in the interval of anarchy between the departure of one
Roman Governor, Festus, and the arrival of another, Albinus, set up a
court of his own, &ldquo;and bringing before it the brother of Jesus

means&rdquo; (<i>The Witnesses</i>, p. 129). &ldquo;The process,&rdquo;
writes Mr. Robertson, &ldquo;of testing the Synoptic Gospels down to an
apparent nucleus of primitive narrative&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;this new
position is one of retreat, and is not permanently tenable&rdquo;
(<i>Christianity and Mythology</i>, p. 284).</p>
<p>If this be so, we had better abolish our chairs of history at the
universities, and give up teaching it in the schools; for, in the
absence of the camera and gramophone, this method is the only one we
can use. When a Mommsen sets Polybius&rsquo;s, Livy&rsquo;s, and
Plutarch&rsquo;s lives of Hannibal side by side and &ldquo;tests them
down to an apparent nucleus of primitive narrative,&rdquo; does Mr.
Robertson take him as a text for a disquisition on &ldquo;the
psychological Resistance to Evidence&rdquo;? If not, why does he forbid
us to take the score or so of independent memories and records of the
career of Jesus which we have in ancient literature <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>between the years <span class="sc">A.D.</span>
50 and 120, and to try to sift them down? Why, without any evidence,
should we rush to the conclusion that the figure on whom they jointly
converge was a Sun-god, solar myth, or vegetation sprite?</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">New Testament literature taken <i>en
bloc</i></span> Secondly, we may note how this disinclination to sift
sources and test documents prompts them to take <i>en bloc</i> sources
and documents which arose separately and in succession. Yet it is not
simple laziness which dictates to them this short and easy method of
dealing with ancient documents. Rather they have inherited it from the
old-fashioned orthodox teachers of a hundred years ago, who, convinced
of the verbal inspiration of the Bible, forbade us to estimate one
passage as evidence more highly than another. All the verses of the
Bible were on a level, as also all the incidents, and to argue that one
event might have happened, but not another, was rank blasphemy. All
were equally certain, for inspiration is not given by measure. Their
mantle has fallen on Mr. Robertson and his friends. All or none is
their method; but, whereas all was equally certain, now all is equally
myth. &ldquo;A document,&rdquo; says (p. 159) the excellent work by MM.
Langlois and Seignobos which I cited above,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">(still more a literary work) is not all of a piece; it
is composed of a great number of independent statements, any one of
which may be intentionally or unintentionally false, while the others
are <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> and accurate&#8202;&hellip;. It is not,
therefore, enough to examine a document as a whole; each of the
statements in it must be examined separately; <i>criticism</i> is
impossible without <i>analysis</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have beautiful examples of such mixed criticism and analysis in
the commentaries on the Synoptics of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>Wellhausen and Loisy,
both of them Freethinkers in the best sense of the word.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Incapacity of this school to understand
evolution of Christian ideas,</span> I have given several minor
examples of the obstinacy with which the three writers I am criticizing
shut their eyes to the gradual evolution of Christian ideas; they
exhibit the same perversity in respect of the great development of
Christological thought already traceable in the New Testament.</p>
<p>Paul conceived of Jesus as a Jewish teacher elevated through his
death and resurrection to the position of Messiah and Son of God. On
earth he is still a merely human being, born naturally, and subject to
the law&mdash;a weak man of flesh. Raised from the dead by the energy
of the Spirit, he becomes future judge of mankind, and his gospel
transcends all distinctions of Jew and Gentile, bondsman or free. In
Mark he is still merely human; he is the son of Joseph and Mary, born
and bred like their other sons and daughters. As a man he comes to John
the Baptist, like others, to confess and repent of his sins, and wash
them away in Jordan&rsquo;s holy stream. Not till then does the descent
of the Spirit on him, as he goes up from the Jordan, confer a
Messiahship on him, which his followers only recognize later on.
Astounding miracles and prodigies, however, are already credited to him
in this our earliest Gospel. In the non-Marcan document, or Q, so far
as we can reconstruct it, he has become Messiah through baptism
(supposing this section to have belonged to Q, and not to some other
document used by Luke and Matthew); but few or no miracles<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3896src" href="#xd25e3896" name="xd25e3896src">1</a>
are as yet credited <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170"
name="pb170">170</a>]</span>to him, and the document contained little
except his teaching. His death has none of the importance assigned to
it by Paul, and is not mentioned; his resurrection does not seem to
have been heard of by the author of this document. In Matthew and Luke
the figure before us is much the same as in Mark; but human traits,
such as his mother&rsquo;s distrust of his mission, are effaced. We
hear no more of his inability to heal those who did not believe in him,
and we get in their early chapters hints of his miraculous birth. In
John there is, indeed, no hint of such birth; but, on the other hand,
the entire Gospel is here rewritten to suit a new conception of him as
the divine, eternal <i>Logos</i>. Demonology tales are ruled out. His
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> as a Jewish Messiah, faithful to the law, has finally
retired into the background, together with that tense expectation of
the end of the world, of the final judgment and installation in
Palestine of a renovated kingdom of David, which inspires the teaching
and parables of the Synoptic Gospels, just as it inspired Philo, and
the Apocalypse of the Fourth Esdras and other contemporary Jewish
apocrypha.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">especially in connection with the legend of
Virgin Birth,</span> Now, in Mr. W. B. Smith&rsquo;s works this
development of doctrine about Jesus, this succession of phases, is not
only reversed, but, with singular perversity, turned upside down.
Similarly, Mr. Robertson and Dr. Drews, in order to secure a favourable
reception for their hypothesis that Jesus was a Sun-god, insist in the
teeth of the evidence that the belief in the Virgin Birth was part and
parcel of the earliest tradition. As a matter <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>of
fact, it was comparatively late, as the heortology or history of the
feasts of the Church shows. Of specially Christian feasts, the first
was the Sunday, which commemorated every week the Resurrection, and the
hope of the Parousia, or Second Coming. The next was the Epiphany, on
January 6, commemorative of the baptism when the Holy Spirit descended
on Jesus and conferred Messiahship.</p>
<p>This feast we cannot trace before the year 125 or 150, and then only
among Basilidians; among Catholics hardly before 300. Just as the story
of the Virgin Birth was the latest addition to evangelical tradition,
so it was the latest of the dominical feasts; and not till 354 did it
obtain separate recognition in Rome on December 25. Of the feast of the
Annunciation and of the other feasts of the Virgin we first hear in the
sixth and succeeding centuries. From this outline we can realize at how
late a period the legend of the Virgin Birth influenced the mind of the
Church at large; yet Mr. Robertson, to smooth the way for his
&ldquo;mythic&rdquo; theory, pretends that it was the earliest of all
Christian beliefs, and without a tittle of evidence invents a
pre-Christian Saviour-Sun-god Joshua, born of a virgin, Miriam. The
whole monstrous conception is a preposterous coinage of his brain, a
figment unknown to anyone before himself and bristling with
impossibilities. Witness the following passage (p. 284 of
<i>Christianity and Mythology</i>), containing nearly as many baseless
fancies as it contains words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The one tenable historic hypothesis left to us at this
stage is that of a preliminary Jesus &ldquo;<span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>,&rdquo; a vague cult-founder such as the Jesus ben
Pandira of the Talmud, put to death for (perhaps anti-Judaic) teachings
now lost; round whose movement there <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>might have gradually
clustered the survivals of an ancient solar or other worship of a Babe
Joshua son of Miriam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is the gist of the speculations of Messrs. Drews and Robertson,
as far removed from truth and reality as the Athanasian Creed and from
sane criticism as the truculent buffooneries of the Futurists from
genuine art.</p>
<p>We have more than once criticized this tendency of Mr. Robertson to
insist on the primitiveness of the Virgin Birth legend. He urges it
throughout his volume, although here and there he seems to see the
truth, as, <i>e.g.</i>, on p. 189, where he remarks that &ldquo;only
the late Third Gospel tells the story&rdquo; of Mary and Joseph going
to Bethlehem to be taxed, and &ldquo;that the narrative in
Matthew&rdquo; was &ldquo;added late to the original composition, which
obviously began at what is now the third chapter.&rdquo; If the legend
was part of the earliest tradition, why does it figure for the first
time in the late Third Gospel and in a late addition to the first? In
another passage he assures us that chapters i and ii of Luke are
&ldquo;a late fabulous introduction.&rdquo; Clearly, his view is that,
just in proportion as any part of the Gospels is late, the tradition it
contains must be early; and he it is who talks about &ldquo;the
methodless subjectivism&rdquo; of Dr. Pfleiderer, who, he says,
&ldquo;like Matthew Arnold, accepts what he likes&rdquo; (p. 450).</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">and in connection with Schmiedel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Pillars&rdquo;</span> The same inability to distinguish what is
early from what is late is shown by Mr. Robertson in his criticism of
Dr. Schmiedel&rsquo;s &ldquo;pillars&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the nine
Gospel texts (seven of them in Mark)&mdash;&ldquo;which cannot have
been invented by believers in the godhood of Jesus, since they
implicitly negate that godhood.&rdquo; Of these, one is <a class=
"biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2010:17&amp;version=NRSV">
Mark x, 17</a> <i>ff.</i>, where Jesus uses&mdash;to one who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>had thrown himself at his feet with the words:
&ldquo;Good teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?&rdquo;
(<i>i.e.</i>, life in the kingdom to come)&mdash;the answer: &ldquo;Why
callest thou me good? No one is good, save one&mdash;to wit,
God.&rdquo; Here many ancient sources intensify Jesus&rsquo;s refusal
of a predicate which is God&rsquo;s alone; for they run: &ldquo;Call
thou me not good.&rdquo; This apart, the Second and Third Gospels may
be said to agree in reading, &ldquo;Good master,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Why
callest thou me good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Matthew, however (xix, 16), we read as follows: &ldquo;Behold,
one came to him and said: Master, what good thing shall I do, that I
may have eternal life? And he said unto him, Why askest thou me
concerning that which is good? One there is who is good,&rdquo;
etc.</p>
<p>Now, it is a result of criticism universally accepted to-day that
Matthew and Luke compiled their Gospels with Mark before them, and that
any reading in which either of them agrees with Mark must be more
original than the discrepant reading of a third. Here Matthew is the
discrepant witness, and he has remodelled the text of Mark to suit the
teaching which had established itself in the Church about <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 100 that Jesus was without sin. He accordingly makes
Jesus reply as a Greek sophist might reply, and not as a Jewish rabbi;
and, by omitting the predicate &ldquo;good&rdquo; before
<i>teacher</i>, he turns the words, &ldquo;One there is who is
good,&rdquo; into nonsense. By adding it before &ldquo;thing&rdquo; he
creates additional nonsense; for how could any but a <i>good</i> action
merit eternal life? The epithet is here superfluous. Even then, if we
were not sure on other grounds that the Marcan story is the only source
of the Matth&aelig;an deformed text, we could be sure that it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>was, because in Mark we have simplicity and good
sense, whereas in Matthew we have neither. Mr. Robertson, on an earlier
page, has, indeed, done lip-service to the truth that Mark presents us
with the earliest form of evangelical tradition; but here he betrays
the fact that he has not really understood the position, nor grasped
the grounds (set forth by me in <i>Myth, Magic, and Morals</i>) on
which it rests. For he is ready to sacrifice it the moment it makes
havoc of his &ldquo;mythological&rdquo; argument, and writes (p. 443):
&ldquo;On the score of simple likelihood, which has the stronger claim?
Surely the original text in Matthew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even if Matthew, Mark, and Luke were rival and independent texts,
instead of the first and third being, as they demonstrably are, copies
and paraphrases of Mark, the best&mdash;if not the only&mdash;criterion
of originality would be such an agreement of two of them as Mark and
Luke here present against Matthew. Mr. Robertson, with entire <i lang=
"la">ignoratio elenchi</i>, urges in favour of the originality of
Matthew&rsquo;s variant the circumstance that the oldest MS. sources of
that Gospel reproduce it. How could they fail to do so, supposing it to
be due to the redactor or editor of Mark, who was traditionally, but
falsely, identified with the apostle Matthew? If the reading of Mark be
not original, how came Luke to copy it from him? The most obvious
critical considerations are wasted on Mr. Robertson and his
friends.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Schmiedel on the disbelief of Mary in her
son</span> Dr. Schmiedel again draws attention to the narrative of how
Jesus, at the beginning of his ministry, was declared by his own
household to be out of his senses, and of how, in consequence, his
mother and brethren followed him in order to put him under restraint.
The story offended the first and third <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>evangelists, and they
partly omit it, partly obscure its drift. The fourth evangelist limits
the disbelief to the brethren of Jesus. The whole narrative is in
flagrant antagonism to the Birth stories in the early chapters of
Matthew and Luke, and to the whole subsequent drift of Church
tradition. Being gifted with common sense, Schmiedel argues that it
must be true, because it could never have been invented. It, anyhow,
makes for the historicity of Jesus. What has Mr. Robertson to say about
it? He writes (p. 443): &ldquo;Why should such a conception be more
alien to Christian consciousness than, say, the story of the trial,
scourging, and crucifixion?&rdquo; Here he ignores the point at issue.
In Christian tradition, whether early or late, it was not the mother
and brethren of Jesus who tried and scourged and crucified him, but
inimical Jews and pagans. The latter are at no time related to have
received an announcement of his birth from an angel, as his mother was
presently believed to have done. We have, therefore, every reason for
averring that the conception or idea of his being flouted by his own
mother and brethren was a thousand times more alien to Christian
consciousness&mdash;at least, any time after <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 100&mdash;than that of his being flouted by a
Sadducean priesthood and by Roman governors. Once the legend of the
Virgin Birth had grown up, such a story could not have been either
thought of or committed to writing in a Gospel. It is read in Mark, and
must be what we call a bed-rock tradition. If Mr. Robertson cannot see
that, he is hopeless. Did he not admit (p. 443) that it is
&ldquo;certainly an odd text,&rdquo; so revealing his inmost misgivings
about it, we should think him so. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176"
href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Jesus is not deified in the earliest
documents, nor do they reveal a &ldquo;cult&rdquo; of him</span> The
same vice of mixing up different phases of the Christian religion shows
itself in the insistence of this school of critic that it was from the
first a <i>cult</i> of a deified Jesus. Thus Mr. Smith writes (<i lang=
"la">Ecce Deus</i>) as follows (p. 6):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We affirm that the worship of the one God under the
name, aspect, or <i>person</i> of the Jesus, the Saviour, was the
primitive and indefectible essence of the primitive teaching and
propaganda.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the contrary, in the two basal documents, Mark and Q, no such
worship is discernible. Jesus first comes on the scene as the humble
son of Joseph and Mary to repent of his sins and purge them away in
Baptism; he next takes up the preaching of the imprisoned John, which
was merely that Jews should repent of their sins because the kingdom of
God, involving a dissolution of the existing social and political
order, was at hand. This was no divine <i>r&ocirc;le</i>, and he is
represented not as God, but only as the servant of God; for such in the
Aramaic dialect of that age was the connotation of the title &ldquo;Son
of God.&rdquo; In Mark there is no sign of his deification, not even in
the transfiguration scene; for in that he is merely the human Messiah
attended by Elias and Moses. From a hundred early <i>indicia</i> we
know that in the Semitic-speaking churches of the East he remained a
human figure for centuries; and the Syrian Father Aphraat, as late as
336 in Persia, is careful to explain in his homilies that Jesus was
only divine as Moses was, or as human kings are. It was not till the
religion was diffused in a pagan medium in which gods had children by
mortal women that the gross deification of Jesus emerged. The purport
of these basal documents, moreover, is not to deify <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>Jesus, but to establish as against the Jews that
he was their promised Messiah and the central figure of the Messianic
kingdom he preached. That figure, however, was never identified with
Jehovah, but was only Jehovah&rsquo;s servant, anointed king and judge
of Israel, restorer of Israel&rsquo;s damaged fortunes, fulfiller of
her political ideals and hopes. Mr. Smith argues that Jesus was deified
from the first because his name was so often invoked in exorcisms. He
even makes the suggestion (p. 17) that the initial letter <i>J</i> of
Jesus &ldquo;must have powerfully suggested Jehovah to the Jewish
consciousness.&rdquo; There is no evidence, and less likelihood, of any
such thing. The name of Jesus was during his lifetime invoked against
demons by exorcists who rejected his message; just as they used the
names of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, so they were ready to exploit his
powerful name; but neither Jews nor Christians ever confounded with
Jehovah the names or personalities they thus invoked; any Jew in virtue
of his birth and breeding would have regarded such a confusion of a man
with his God as flat blasphemy.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Worship of a slain God no part of the
earliest Christianity</span> Messrs. Robertson and Drews similarly
insist that Jesus was from the first worshipped as a slain God. In the
Gospel documents there is no sign of anything of the sort. It was Paul
who first diffused the idea that the crucified Jesus was a victim slain
for the redemption of human sins. We already have Philo proclaiming
that the just man is the ransom of the many, so that there is no need
to go to pagan circles, no need to go outside the pale of Greek Jews,
of whom Paul was one, for the origin of the idea. He probably found it
even in the teaching of Gamaliel, in which he was brought up. Mark asks
no more of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>his readers than to attribute the
Messiahship&mdash;a thoroughly human <i>r&ocirc;le</i>&mdash;to his
hero, Jesus of Nazareth. Nor does Matthew, who seeks at every turn to
prove that the actions of Jesus reported by Mark were those which,
according to the old prophets, a Messiah might be expected to perform.
How can writers who end their record of Jesus by telling us how in the
moment of death he cried, &ldquo;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
me?&rdquo; realizing no doubt that all his expectations of the advent
of God&rsquo;s kingdom were frustrated and set at naught; how, I say,
can such writers have believed that Jesus was Jehovah? The idea is
monstrous. The truth is these writers transport back into the first age
of Christianity the ideas and beliefs of developed Catholicism, and are
resolved that the first shall be last and the last first. They have no
perspective, and no capacity for understanding the successive phases
through which a primitive Messianism, at first thoroughly monotheistic
and exclusively Jewish in outlook and ideals, gradually evolved itself,
with the help of the Logos teaching, into the Athanasian cult of an
eternal and consubstantial Son of God.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Abuse of the comparative method by this
school of writers</span> Thirdly, these writers abuse the comparative
method. Applied discreetly and rationally, this method helps us to
trace myths and beliefs back to their homes and earlier forms. Thus M.
Emmanuel Cosquin (in <i>Romania</i>; Paris, 1912) takes the story of
the cat and the candle, and traces out its ramifications in the
medi&aelig;val literature and modern folklore of Europe, and outside
Europe, in the legends of the Pendjab, of Cashmir, Bengal, Ceylon,
Tibet, Tunisia, Annam, and elsewhere. But the theme is always
sufficiently like itself to be really recognizable in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>various folklore frames in which it is found
encased. The old philologists saw in the most superficial resemblance
of sound a reason for connecting words in different languages. They
never asked themselves how a word got out of Hebrew, say, into Greek,
or out of Greek into Mexican. Volumes were filled with these haphazard
etymologies, and the idea of the classification of languages into great
connected families only slowly made its way among us in the last
century. I have pointed out that in regard to names Messrs. Drews and
Robertson are still in this prephilological stage of inquiry; as
regards myths or stories of incident, they are wholly immersed in it.
<span class="marginnote">They fit anything on to anything no matter how
ineptly,</span>They never trouble themselves to make sure that the
stories they connect bear any real resemblance to one another. For
example, what have the Zodiacal signs and the Apostles of Jesus in
common except the number twelve? As if number was not the most
superficial of attributes, the least characteristic and essential. The
scene of the Gospel is laid in Jud&aelig;a, where from remote antiquity
the Jews had classed themselves in twelve tribes. Is it not more likely
that this suggested the twelve missionaries sent out by Jesus to
announce the coming kingdom than the twelve signs of the Zodiac? Even
if the story of the Twelve be legendary, need we go outside Judaism for
our explanation of its origin?</p>
<p>What, again, have the three Maries in common with the Greek
<i>Moirai</i> except the number three and a delusive community of
sound? Yet Mr. Robertson insists that the three Maries at the tomb of
Jesus were suggested by the <i>Moirai</i>, because these, &ldquo;as
goddesses of birth and death, naturally figured in many artistic
presentations of religious death scenes.&rdquo; As a matter
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>of fact, the representation of the <i>Parcae</i>
or Fates in connection with death is rare except on Roman sarcophagi,
mostly of later date than the Gospel story. And when they are so found,
they represent, not women bringing spices for the corpse or mourning
for the dead, but the forces, often thought of as blind and therefore
represented as veiled, which govern the events of the world, including
birth, life and death. <span class="marginnote">and forget the innate
hostility of Jews to Paganism</span>There was, therefore, nothing in
the <i>Moirai</i> to suggest the three Maries at the tomb; nor is it
credible that the Hebrew <i>Christists</i>, given as they must have
been to monotheism and detesting all statuary, pagan or other, would
have chosen their literary motives from such a source. Where could they
see such statuary in or about Jerusalem? It is notorious that the very
presence of a symbolic eagle used as a military standard was enough to
create an <i lang="fr">&eacute;meute</i> in Jerusalem. The scheme of
the emperor Caligula or Caius to set up his statue in Jerusalem in
39&ndash;40 <span class="sc">A.D.</span> provoked a movement of revolt
throughout Palestine, with which the Jews of Egypt and elsewhere were
in full sympathy. A deputation headed by Philo of Alexandria went to
Rome to supplicate the emperor not to goad the entire race to frenzy.
In the magnificent statues which surrounded him on the Parthenon hill,
Paul could see nothing but idols, monuments of an age of superstition
and ignorance which God had mercifully overlooked.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e4069src" href="#xd25e4069" name="xd25e4069src">2</a> The
hostility of the Jews to all pagan art <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>and sculpture was as
great as that of Mohammedans to-day. Yet Mr. Robertson asks us to
believe (p. 327) that the Gospel myths, as he assumes them to be, are
&ldquo;evolved from scenes in pagan art.&rdquo; On the top of that we
afterwards learn from him that it was the Jewish high priest with
legalistic leanings that presided over the <i>Christists</i> or
<i>Jesuists</i>. Imagine such a high priest&rsquo;s feelings when he
beheld his &ldquo;secret society&rdquo; evolving their system under
such an inspiration as Mr. Robertson outlines in the following canons
of criticism:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">As we have seen and shall see throughout this
investigation, the Christian system is a patchwork of a hundred
suggestions drawn from pagan art and ritual usage (p. 305).</p>
<p>Christism borrowed myths of all kinds from paganism (p. xii).</p>
<p>&hellip; the whole Christian legend, in its present terminology, is
demonstrably an adaptation of a mass of pre-Christian myths (p.
136).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a budget of mutually destructive paradoxes; and to crown them
all Mr. Robertson claims in his introduction (p. xxii) that the method
of his treatise is</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">in general more &ldquo;positive,&rdquo; less a priori,
more obedient to scientific canons than that of the previous critics
&hellip; who have reached similar anti-traditionalist results. It
substitutes an anthropological basis, in terms of the concrete
phenomena of mythology, for a pseudo-philosophical presupposition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Credulity attends hypercriticism</span>
Fourthly, it is essential to note the childish, all-embracing, and
overwhelming credulity of these writers. To them applies in its full
force the paragraph in which MM. Langlois and Seignobos describe the
perils which beset hypercriticism (p. 131, <i>op. cit.</i>):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The excess of criticism, just as much as the crudest
ignorance, leads to error. It consists in the application of critical
canons to cases outside their jurisdiction. It is related to criticism
as logic-chopping is to logic. There are persons who scent enigmas
everywhere, even where there are none. They take perfectly clear texts
and subtilize on them till they make them doubtful, under the pretext
of freeing them from imaginary corruptions. They discover traces of
forgery in authentic documents. A strange state of mind! By constantly
guarding against the instinct of credulity they come to suspect
everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For these writers, in their anxiety to be original and new, see fit
to discard every position that earlier historians, like Mommsen,
Gibbon, Bury, Montefiore&mdash;not to mention Christian
scholars&mdash;have accepted as beyond doubt. Their temper is that of
the Bacon-Shakesperians; and the plainest, simplest, most
straightforward texts figure in their imaginations as a laborious
series of charades, rebuses, and cryptograms. That Jesus never existed
is not really the final conclusion of their researches, but an initial
unproved assumption. In order to get rid of him, they feign, without
any evidence of it, a Jewish secret society under the patronage of the
Jewish High Priest, that existed in Jerusalem well down into the
Christian era. This society kept up the worship of an old Palestinian
and Ephraimitic Sun-god and Saviour, named Joshua, son of a virgin,
Miriam. Where is the proof that such a god was ever heard of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>in ancient Palestine, either early or late, or
that such a cult ever existed? There is none. It is the emptiest and
wildest of hypotheses; yet we are asked to accept it in place of the
historicity of Jesus. What, again, do we know of secret societies in
Jerusalem? Josephus and Philo knew of none. For the Therapeut&aelig;,
far from affecting secrecy, were anxious to diffuse their discipline
and lore even among the Hellenes, while the Essenes had nothing secret
save the names of the angels they invoked in spells. They were a
well-known sect, and so numerous that a gate of Jerusalem was called
the Essene Gate, because they so often came in and went forth by it.
Were the Pharisees and Sadducees, the Scribes, or the <i lang=
"la">Sicarii</i> or zealots, secret sects? We know they were not. But
is it likely that a sect composed in the main of Jews, and patronized,
as Mr. Robertson argues, by the High Priest, would have kept up in the
very heart of monotheistic Judaism a cult of Sun-gods and
Vegetation-spirits? Could they there have given themselves up to the
study of pagan statuary, art, and ritual dramas? What possible
connection is there between the na&iuml;ve picture of Hebrew Messianism
we have in the Synoptic Gospels and the hurly-burly, the tagrag and
bobtail of pagan mythologies which Mr. Robertson and his henchman Drews
rake together pell-mell in their pretentious volumes? How did all this
paganism abut in a Messianic society which reverenced the Old Testament
for its sacred scriptures, which for long frequented the Jewish Temple,
took over the feasts and fasts of Judaism, modelled its prayers on
those of the Synagogue, cherished in its eastern branches the practice
of circumcision?</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mr. Robertson accepts the historicity of
Jesus after all</span>After hundreds of pages devoted to the task of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>evaporating Jesus into a Solar or
Vegetation-god, and all the personages we meet in the Gospels into
zodiacal signs or pagan demigods, Mr. Robertson, as we have noticed
above, finds himself, after all, confronted with the same personages in
Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. There they are too real even for Mr. Robertson
to dissipate them into cloud-forms, and too numerous to be cut out
wholesale. He feels that, if all Paul&rsquo;s allusions to the
crucified Jesus are to be got rid of as interpolations, then no Pauline
Epistles will remain. He cuts out, indeed, all he can, but there is a
residuum of reality. To identify Paul&rsquo;s Jesus with the Jesus of
the Gospels is too humdrum and obvious a course for him. So
common-sense and commonplace a scheme does not suit his subtle
intelligence; moreover, such an identification would upset the hundreds
of pages in which he has proved that Jesus of Nazareth and all his
accessories are literary symbols employed by the Jewish
&ldquo;Jesuists&rdquo; to disguise their pagan art and myths.
Accordingly, he asks us to believe that Paul&rsquo;s Jesus is a certain
Jesus Ben Pandira, stoned to death a hundred years earlier. This Jesus
is a vague figure fished up out of the Talmud; but, on examination, we
found Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s choice of him as an alias for Paul&rsquo;s
Jesus to be most unfortunate, for competent Talmudic scholars are
agreed that Jesus Ben Pandira in the Talmud was no other than Jesus of
Nazareth in the Gospels. Jesus most unkindly insists on being in at his
own death,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4125src" href="#xd25e4125" name=
"xd25e4125src">3</a> in spite of all Mr. Robertson can say or do; and
his house of cards is crowned with the discovery that the apostles whom
Paul knew&mdash;not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185"
name="pb185">185</a>]</span>being identical with the signs of the
Zodiac, like those of the Gospels&mdash;were no other than the twelve
apostles of the Jewish High Priest, and that they were the authors of
the lately-discovered &ldquo;Teaching of the Apostles.&rdquo; He is
very contemptuous for other early Christian books which affect
apostolic authorship in their titles, but falls a ready victim to the
relatively late and anonymous editor of this &ldquo;teaching,&rdquo;
who to give it vogue entitled it &ldquo;The Teaching of the Lord by the
Twelve Apostles to the Gentiles.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Jesuist sect,&rdquo;
he writes (p. 345), &ldquo;founded on it <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e4130" title="Added by author">(</span>the
<i>Didach&eacute;</i><span class="corr" id="xd25e4136" title=
"Corrected by author from: ,">)</span> the Christian myth of the Twelve
Apostles of Jesus.&rdquo; Everywhere else in his books he has argued
that the &ldquo;myth&rdquo; in question was founded on the signs of the
Zodiac. Why give up at the eleventh hour the astral explanation for an
utterly different one? I may add that in the body of the
<i>Didach&eacute;</i> the Twelve are nowhere alluded to; that it must
be a much later document than the Gospels and Paulines, since it quotes
them in scores of passages; and that the interpolation of the title,
with a reference to the Twelve Apostles, was a literary trick scarcely
older than the fourth century, long before which age the Pauline
account of the resurrection was cited by a score of Christian writers.
Lastly, we are fain to inquire of Mr. Robertson with whom he identifies
&ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; of the above title&mdash;with the Jewish High
Priest, or with Jesus Ben Pandira, or with the Sun-God-Saviour
Joshua.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Theory of interpolations</span> I have
given many examples of the tendency of all these authors to condemn as
an interpolation any text which contradicts their hypotheses. There is
only one error worse than that of treating seriously documents which
are no documents at all. It is that of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>the man who cannot
recognize documents when he has got them. It is well, of course, to
weigh sources, and the critical investigation of authorship lies at the
basis of all true history. But, as the authors above cited justly
remark (p. 99):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We must not abuse it. The extreme of distrust in these
matters is almost as mischievous as the extreme of credulity.
P&egrave;re Hardouin, who attributed the works of Virgil and Horace to
medieval monks, was every whit as ridiculous as the victim of
Vrain-Lucas. It is an abuse of the methods of this species of criticism
to apply them, as has been done, indiscriminately, for the mere
pleasure of it. The bunglers who have used this species of criticism to
brand as spurious perfectly genuine documents, such as the writings of
Hroswitha, the <i>Ligurinus</i>, and the bull <i lang="la">unam
sanctam</i>, or to establish imaginary filiations between certain
annals, on the strength of superficial indications, would have
discredited criticism before now, if that had been possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is unhappily easier to discredit criticism in the realm of
ecclesiastical than of secular history; and this school of writers are
doing their best to harm the cause of true Rationalism. They only
afford amusement to the obscurantists of orthodoxy, and render doubly
difficult the task of those who seek to win people over to a
common-sense and historical envisagement, unencumbered by tradition and
superstition, of the problems of early Christianity.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Professor Smith&rsquo;s monotheistic
cult</span> Lastly, it is a fact deserving of notice that the genesis
of Christianity as these authors present it is much more mysterious and
obscure than before. Their explanation needs explaining. What, we must
ask, was the motive and end in view of the adherents of the
pre-Christian Jesus or Joshua in writing the Gospels and bringing down
their God to earth, so humanizing in a story their divine myth? Let
Professor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>W. B. Smith speak: &ldquo;What was the essence,
the central idea and active principle, of the cult itself?&rdquo; Here
he means the cult of the pre-Christian Christ that invented the Gospels
and diffused them on the market place. &ldquo;To this latter,&rdquo; he
continues, &ldquo;we answer directly and immediately: It was a
<i>Protest against idolatry</i>; it was a <i>Crusade for
monotheism</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet he cannot adduce a single text from the Gospels&mdash;not
even from the Fourth&mdash;which betrays on the part of Jesus, their
central figure, any such crusading spirit. Jesus everywhere assumes his
hearers to be monotheists like himself&mdash;he speaks as a Jew to
Jews&mdash;and perpetually reminds them of their Father in heaven. Thus
<a class="biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%206:8&amp;version=NRSV">
Matt. vi, 8</a>: &ldquo;Your Father knoweth what things ye have need

Matt. v, 48</a>: &ldquo;Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly
Father is perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monotheism of those who stood around the teacher is ever taken
for granted by the evangelists, and in all the precepts of Jesus not
one can be adduced that is aimed at the sins of polytheism and
idolatry. His message lies in a far different region. It is the
immediate advent of the Messianic kingdom, and the need of repentance
ere it come. Only when Paul undertakes to bear this message to pagans
outside the pale of Judaism do we get teaching directed against
idolatry; and in his Epistles such precepts have a second place, the
first being reserved to the preaching of the coming kingdom and of the
redemption of the world by the merits of the crucified and risen
Messiah, the man Jesus. Most of Paul&rsquo;s letters read as if those
for whom he wrote them were already proselytes familiar with the Jewish
scriptures. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">His great Oriental cryptogram</span> Such
is Mr. Smith&rsquo;s fundamental assumption, and it is baseless. On it
he bases his next great hypothesis of &ldquo;the primitive secrecy of
the Jesus cult,&rdquo; which &ldquo;was maintained in some measure for
many years&mdash;for generations even&rdquo; (p. 45).
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he asks, &ldquo;was this Jesus cult originally
secret, and expressed in such guarded parabolic terms as made it
unintelligible to the multitude?&rdquo; The reason lay in the fact that
&ldquo;it was exactly to save the pagan multitude from idolatry that
Jesus came into the world&rdquo; (p. 38).</p>
<p>Here the phrase &ldquo;Jesus came into the world,&rdquo; like all
else he did or suffered, is, of course, to be understood in a
Pickwickian sense, for he never came into the world at all. The Gospels
are not only a romance concocted by &ldquo;such students of religion as
the first Christians were&rdquo; (p. 65), and inspired by their study
of Plato,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4190src" href="#xd25e4190" name=
"xd25e4190src">4</a> and of the best elements in ancient mythology;
they are a romance throughout&mdash;an allegory of a secret
pre-Christian Nazarene society and of its secret cult (p. 34). Of this
society, he tells us, we know nothing; esoterism and cult secrecy were
its chief interests; the &ldquo;silence of the Christians about it was
intentional,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4199src" href=
"#xd25e4199" name="xd25e4199src">5</a> and, except for the special
revelation vouchsafed the other day to Professor W. B. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>Smith, it would have remained for ever unknown,
and Christianity for ever enigmatic.</p>
<p>In accordance with this postulate of esoterism and cult secrecy
among the pre-Christian Nazarenes, who subsequently revealed themselves
to the world as the Christian Church, though even then they
&ldquo;maintained for generations the secrecy<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4206src" href="#xd25e4206" name="xd25e4206src">6</a> of their
Jesus cult,&rdquo; the Gospels, as I said, are an allegory or a
charade. Their <i lang="la">prima facie</i> meaning is never the true
one, never more than symbolic of a moral and spiritual undersense such
as old allegorists like Philo and Origen loved to discover in the
Bible. Thus, as we saw above, when Jesus is reported to have cast out
of the Jews who thronged around him devils of blindness, deafness,
lameness, leprosy, death, what is really intended is that he argued
pagans out of their polytheism. &ldquo;It was spiritual maladies, and
only spiritual, that he was healing&rdquo; (p. 38). We ask of Mr.
Smith, why was so much mystification necessary? We are only told that
&ldquo;it was in the main a prudential measure, well enough justified,
but intended to be only temporary&rdquo; (p. 39). What exact risks they
were to shun which the sect kept itself secret, and only spake in
far-fetched allegory, Mr. Smith does not inform us. Is he, too, afraid
of being regarded as a &ldquo;tell-tale&rdquo; (p. 48)?</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Professor Smith resolves all the New
Testament as symbolic and allegorical</span> As with the exorcisms, so
with all else told of Jesus. None of it really happened. As he never
lived, so he never died. His human life and death are an allegory of
the spiritual cult and mysteries which the pre-Christian Nazarenes and
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>descendants, the Christians, so jealously and
for so long guarded in silence. If he never lived, then he never
taught, not even in parables. By consequence the entire record of his
parables, still more of his having chosen the parable as his medium of
instruction in order to veil his real meaning from his audience, is all
moonshine. Here, as elsewhere, the Gospel text does not mean what it
says, but is itself only a Nazarene parable conveying, or rather
concealing, a Nazarene secret&mdash;what sort of secret no one, save
Professor Smith, the self-appointed revealer of their mysterious lore,
can tell, and he is silent on the point. On Mr. Smith&rsquo;s
premisses, then, we cannot rely on the Gospels to inform us of anything
historical, and, so far as we can follow him, we must, if we would
discern through them the mind of their Nazarene authors, take them
upside down. We must discern a pagan medium and homilies against
polytheism in discourses addressed to monotheistic Jews who needed no
warnings against idolatry; we must also read the stories of Jesus
healing paralytics and demoniacs as secret and disguised polemics
against idolatry.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Yet claims, where it suits him, to treat it
as historical narrative</span> But here mark Professor Smith&rsquo;s
inconsistency. Why is he sure that the Nazarenes, and after them the
earliest Christians, were a secret society with a secret cult? They
must have been so, he argues, because Jesus taught in parables.
&ldquo;The primitive esoterism,&rdquo; he tells us, &ldquo;is
admittedly present in <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%204:11-12&amp;version=NRSV">
Mark iv, 11, 12</a>, <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%204:33-44&amp;version=NRSV">
33, 34</a>.&rdquo; These verses begin thus: &ldquo;And <i>he</i> said
unto them, unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of heaven: but
unto them that are without, all things are done in parables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Smith&rsquo;s postulate is that
<i>he</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Jesus of Nazareth&mdash;never lived, and
so never said anything <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href=
"#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>to anyone. How, then, can he
appeal to what <i>he</i> said to prove that there was a pre-Christian
Jesus or Joshua sect, itself secret with a cult and ritual which its
members were ever on their guard not to reveal? Surely he drops here
into two assumptions which he has discarded <i lang="la">ab initio</i>:
first, that there is a core of real history in the Gospels; and,
second, that the Gospel can mean what it says, and that its Nazarene
author is here not allegorizing, as he usually did.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">His theory contradicts itself</span> But
even if we allow Mr. Smith to break with his premisses wherever he
needs to do so in order to substantiate them, do these verses of Mark
support his hypothesis of a sect which kept itself, its rites, and its
teaching secret? I admit that it was pretty successful when it veiled
its anti-idolatrous teaching under the outward form of demonological
anecdotes, and wrote Jews when it meant Pagans and Polytheists. But in
<a class="biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%204:34&amp;version=NRSV">
Mark iv, 34</a>, we are told that &ldquo;to his own disciples Jesus
privately expounded all things&rdquo; after he had with many parables
spoken the word to such as &ldquo;were able to hear it.&rdquo; It
appears, then, that for all their love of secrecy, and in spite of all
their precautions against &ldquo;tell-tale&rdquo; writing, the
Nazarenes on occasions went out of their way, in their allegorical
romance of their God Joshua, to inform all who may read it what their
parables and allegories meant; for in it Jesus sits down and expounds
to the reader over some twenty-four verses (verses 10&ndash;34) the
inner meaning of the parables which he had just addressed to the
multitude. What on earth were the Nazarenes doing to publish a Gospel
like this, and so let the cat out of the bag? Instead of keeping their
secret they were proclaiming it on the housetops. Again, if the Gospels
are to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>such an extent merely allegorical, that we must
not assume their authors to have believed that Jesus ever lived, how
can we possibly rely on them for information about such an obscure
matter as a secret and esoteric pre-Christian Nazarene sect? We can
only be sure that the evangelists never under any circumstances meant
what they said; yet Mr. Smith, in defiance of all his postulates,
writes, p. 40, as follows: &ldquo;On the basis, then, of this passage
alone [<i>i.e.</i>, <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%204:10-34&amp;version=NRSV">
Mark iv, 10&ndash;34</a>] we may confidently affirm the primitive
secrecy of the Jesus cult.&rdquo; Even if the passage rightly yielded
the sense he tries to extort from it, how can we be sure that that
sense is not, like the rest of the Gospel, an allegory of something
else?</p>
<p>The other passage of the Gospels, <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2010:26-27&amp;version=NRSV">
Matthew x, 26, 27</a>, to which, with like inconsistency, Mr. Smith
appeals by way of showing that the Nazarenes of set purpose hid their
light under a bushel, does not bear the interpretation he puts on it.
It runs thus: &ldquo;Fear them not therefore: for naught is covered
that shall not be revealed, and hidden that shall not be known. What I
tell you in the darkness, speak ye on the housetops; and what ye hear
in the ear, proclaim upon the housetops.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Absence of esoterism about Jesus&rsquo;s
teaching</span> The reasonable interpretation of the above is that
Jesus, being in possession, as he thought, of a special understanding,
perhaps revelation, of the true nature of the Messianic kingdom, and
convinced of its near approach, instructed his immediate disciples in
privacy concerning it in order that they might carry the message up and
down the land to the children of Israel. He therefore exhorts them not
to be silent from fear of the Jews, who accused him of being
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>possessed of a devil, somewhat as his own mother
and brethren accused him of being an <i lang="fr">exalt&eacute;</i> and
beside himself. No, they were to cast aside all apprehensions; they
must go, not to the supercilious Pharisees or to the comfortable
priests who battened on the people, still less to Gentiles and
Samaritans, who had no part in the promises made to Israel, but to the
lost sheep of the house of Israel, and they must preach as they went,
saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. They were to heal the sick,
raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out devils, and in general
give freely the good tidings which freely they had received from their
Master, and he from John the Baptist. If they so acted, discarding all
timidity, then no human repression, no human time-serving, could
prevent the spread of the good news. What was now hidden from the poor
and ignorant among his compatriots would henceforth, thanks to the
courage and devotedness of his emissaries, be made known to them; what
was now covered, be revealed.</p>
<p>Such is the context of &ldquo;this remarkable deliverance,&rdquo; as
Mr. Smith terms it; and nothing in all the New Testament savours less
than it does of a secret cult of mysterious sectaries, waiting for Mr.
Smith to manifest their <i>arcana</i> to us twenty centuries later.
Here, as everywhere else in the New Testament, he has discovered a
monstrous mare&rsquo;s nest; has banished the only possible and obvious
interpretation, in order to substitute a chimera of his own.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">It was not a protest against
paganism</span> Mr. Smith credits his hypothetical pre-Christian
Nazarenes with an ambition and anxiety to purge away the errors of
mankind. The &ldquo;essence, the central idea, and active principle of
the cult itself,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href=
"#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>he tells us (p. 45), &ldquo;was a
<i>protest against Idolatry, a crusade for monotheism</i>.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The fact of the primitive worship of Jesus and the fact of the
primitive mission to all the Gentiles are the two cardinal facts of
Proto-Christianity&rdquo; (p. xvii). Why on earth, then, in concocting
that pronunciamento of their cult which we call the Gospels, did these
Nazarenes represent <i>the</i> Jesus or Joshua God, even in allegory,
as warning his disciples on no account to disseminate his cult among
Gentiles and Samaritans, but only among Jews, who were notoriously
monotheists and bitterly hostile to every form of idolatry? Why carry
coals to Newcastle on so huge a scale?</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Why turn God Jeshua into a man at
all</span> And granted that the Nazarenes, in their anxiety to be
parabolical and misunderstood of their readers, wrote Jews when they
meant Pagans, was it necessary in the interests of their monotheistic
crusade to nickname their One God Jesus, to represent him as a man and
a carpenter, with brothers and sisters, and a mother that did not
believe in him; as a man who was a Jew with the prejudices of a Jew, a
man circumcised and insisting that he came not to destroy the law of
Moses, but to fulfil it; as a man who was born like other men of a
human father and mother; was crucified, dead and buried; whose
disciples and Galilean companions, when in the first flush of their
grief they heard from Mary Magdalene the strange story of his first
appearing to her after death, still &ldquo;disbelieved&rdquo;?<a class=

<p><span class="marginnote">The comfort of the initial
&ldquo;J&rdquo;</span> These Nazarenes were, in their quality of
&ldquo;students of religion&rdquo; (p. 65), intent on converting the
world <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>from polytheism. Why, then, did they call their
sublime deity by the name of Jesus? &ldquo;The word <i>Jesus</i>
itself,&rdquo; writes Mr. Smith,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">also made special appeal to the Jewish consciousness,
for it was practically identical with their own Jeshua, now understood
by most to mean strictly Jah-help, but easily confounded with a similar
J&rsquo;shu&rsquo;ah, meaning <i>Deliverance</i>, <i>Saviour</i>,
<i>Witness</i>, <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%201:21&amp;version=NRSV">
Matthew i, 21</a>. Moreover, the initial letter J, so often
representing Jah in Hebrew words, must have powerfully suggested
Jehovah to the Jewish consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what Jew of the first century, however fond of the tales about
Joshua which he read in his scriptures, was ever minded to substitute
his name for that of Jehovah merely because it began with a <i>J</i>
and has been explained by twentieth-century Hebraists as meaning
<i>Jah-help</i>? The idea is exquisitely humorous. While they were
about it why did the Nazarenes not adopt the name Immanuel, which in
that allegorical romance (which from Mr. Smith we know to be the
character of Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel) they fished up out of the Hebrew
prophet Isaiah? If Jehovah was not good enough for them, Immanuel was
surely better than the name Jeshua, with its associations of pillage
and murder. But apart from these considerations, as the name
<i>Jeshua</i> is Hebrew, it follows that the secret sectaries who had
this cult must have been of a Jewish cast. But, if so, what Jew, we
ask, ever heard of a God called Jeshua or Joshua? As I have already
pointed out, the very memory of such a God, if there ever was one,
perished long before the Book of Joshua could have been written. Like
the gods Daoud and Joseph, with whom writers of this class seek to
conjure our wits out of our heads, a god Joshua is a mere preposterous
superfetation of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196"
name="pb196">196</a>]</span>disordered imagination. &ldquo;There were
abundant reasons,&rdquo; writes Mr. Smith (p. 16),</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">why the name <i>Jesus</i> should be the Aaron&rsquo;s
rod to swallow up all other designations. Its meaning, which was
<i>felt</i> to be Saviour, was grand, comforting, uplifting. The notion
of the world-Saviour thrust its roots into the loam of the remotest
antiquity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="marginnote">Supposed confusion of Jesus with
<i>i&#275;somai</i></span> One regrets to have to criticize such
dithyrambic outpourings of Mr. Smith&rsquo;s heart. But, granted there
was a widespread expectation, such as Suetonius records, of Messiahs
who were to issue from Jud&aelig;a and conquer all the world, who ever
heard of the name Joshua being assigned in advance to one of them? Who
ever in that age <i>felt</i> the name <i>Jesus</i> to be grand,
comforting, uplifting? Is not Mr. Smith attributing his own feelings,
as he sat in a Sunday school, to Jews and Gentiles of the first
century? I add Gentiles, for he pretends that the name Jesus appealed
to the Greek consciousness also as a derivative of the Ionic future
<span class="trans" title="I&#275;somai"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#7992;&#8053;&sigma;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&iota;</span></span>
<i>i&#275;somai</i> = I will heal. Now what Christian writer ever made
this <i>rapprochement</i>? Not a single one. Surely, if we are minded
to argue the man Jesus out of existence, we ought to have a <i lang=
"la">vera causa</i> to put in his place, a belief, or, if we like it
better, a myth which was really believed, and is known to have entered
deeply into the lives and consciences of men? It is true that the idea
of a Messiah did so enter, but not in the form in which Mr. Smith loves
to conceive it. The Messiah was such a human figure as Suetonius had
heard of; he was a man who should, as we read in Acts, restore the
kingdom of David. &ldquo;Lord, dost Thou at this time restore the
kingdom to Israel?&rdquo; is the question the apostles are said
(<a class="biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"

before them had revived the Messianic hopes which his death had so
woefully dashed. The incident is probably apocryphal, yet its presence
in the narrative illustrates what a Messiah was then expected by
Christians to achieve. Judas Maccab&aelig;us, Cyrus, Bar Cochba, Judas
of Galilee&mdash;these and other heroes of Israel had the quality of
Messiahs. They were all men, and not myths. The suggestion, then, that
the name Jesus was one to conjure with is idle and baseless; and if his
name had been Obadiah or Nathaniel, Professor Smith would have been
equally ready to prove that these were attractive names, bound to
triumph and &ldquo;swallow up all other designations.&rdquo; He only
pitches on the name of Jesus for his pre-Christian Saviour-god because
he finds it in the Gospels; but inasmuch as he sees in them mere
allegorical romances, entirely unhistorical and having no root in
facts, there is no reason for adopting from them one name more than
another. How does he know that the appellation Jesus is not as much of
a Nazarene fiction as he holds every other name and person and incident
to be which the Gospels contain? Is it not more probable that this
highly secretive sect, with their horror of &ldquo;tell-tale,&rdquo;
would keep secret the name of their Saviour-god, as the Essenes kept
secret the names of their patron angels? The truth is, even Mr. Smith
cannot quite divest himself of the idea that there is some historical
basis for the Gospels; otherwise he would not have turned to them for
the name of his Saviour-god.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mr. Smith denies all historicity to Acts
and Epistles</span> More consistently, however, than Mr. Robertson,
Professor Smith denies that there are any allusions to the real Jesus
in the rest of the New Testament. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198"

he says (p. 23), &ldquo;recognize at all the <i>life of Jesus as a
man</i>,&rdquo; though &ldquo;their general tenour gives great value to
the <i>death of Jesus as a God</i>.&rdquo; This is a new reading of the
documents in question, for the Pauline conviction was that Jesus had
been crucified and died <i>as a man</i>, and, being raised up from
death by the Spirit, had been promoted to be, what he was antenatally,
a super-human or angelic figure<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4404src"
href="#xd25e4404" name="xd25e4404src">8</a>&mdash;a Christ or Messiah,
who was to come again on earth and judge mankind. Of his mere humanity
while on this earth, and as long as he was associating with human
disciples, Paul entertained no doubts. How could he, inasmuch as he had
stayed with them at Jerusalem? Mr. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199"
href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>Robertson, as we saw,
although he dissipates Jesus in the Gospels into a Sun-God-Saviour
Joshua, nevertheless is so impressed by the Pauline &ldquo;references
to a crucified Jesus&rdquo; (p. 364) that he resuscitates Jesus Ben
Pandira out of the limbo of the Talmud. Perhaps he strains at a gnat
after swallowing a camel. Anyhow, I will leave Mr. Smith to settle
accounts with him, and turn to a fresh point, which has not occurred to
either of them.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Contrast of Christian belief in Jesus with
cult of Adonis or Osiris</span> It is this. Adonis and Osiris were
never regarded by their votaries as having been human beings that had
recently lived and died on the face of this earth. The Christians, in
strong contrast with them and with all other pagans ever heard of, did
so regard Jesus from first to last. Why so, when they knew that from
the first he was a God and up in heaven? Why has the fact of his
unreality, as these writers argue it, left no trace of itself in
Christian tradition and literature? According to this new school of
critics, the Nazarenes, when they wrote down the Gospels, knew
perfectly well that Jesus was a figment, and had never lived at all.
And yet we never get a hint that he was only a myth, and that the New
Testament is a gigantic <i lang="fr">fumisterie</i>. Why so? Why from
the very first did the followers of Jesus entertain what Mr. Smith
denounces as &ldquo;an a priori concept of the Jesus&rdquo; (p. 35)?
Why, in other words, were they convinced from the beginning that he was
a man of flesh and blood, who had lived on earth among them? The
&ldquo;early secrecy,&rdquo; the &ldquo;esoterism of the primitive
cult&rdquo; (p. 39), says Mr. Smith, &ldquo;was intended to be only
temporary.&rdquo; If so, why could not the Nazarenes, primarily
interested as they were, not in lies and bogus, but in disseminating
their lofty monotheism, have thrown <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>off the disguise some
time or other, and explained to their spiritual children that the
intensely concrete life of Jesus which they had published in our Gospel
of Mark meant nothing; that it was all an allegory, and no more, of a
Saviour-god, who had never existed as a human being, nor even as the
docetic phantasmagoria of the Gnostic? &ldquo;Something sealed the lips
of that (Nazarene) evangelist,&rdquo; and the Nazarenes have kept their
secret so well through the ages that it has been reserved for Mr. Smith
first to pierce the veil and unlock their mystery. He it is who has at
last discovered that &ldquo;in proto-Mark we behold the manifest
God&rdquo; (p. 24).</p>
<p>Now what possessed the Nazarenes so firmly to impose on the world
through the Gospels an erroneous view of their God, that for 2,000
years not only their spiritual offspring, the Christians, but Jews and
pagans as well, have believed him to have lived on earth, a man of
flesh and blood and of like passions with themselves? Was the deception
necessary? The votaries of Osiris and Adonis were never so tricked. The
adherents of the Augustalian cult, the pious Greeks and Syrians who
thronged to be healed of their diseases at the shrines of Apollonius,
believed, of course, that their patron saints and gods had lived, prior
to their apotheosis, upon earth; and so they had. But a follower of
Osiris or &AElig;sculapius would have opened his eyes wide with
astonishment if you asked him to believe that his Saviour had died only
the other day in Jud&aelig;a. Not so a Christian; for the Nazarene
monotheists had so thoroughly fooled him with their Gospels that he was
ready to supply you with dates and pedigrees and all sorts of other
details about his Saviour&rsquo;s personal history. And yet all the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>time, had he only known it, his religion
laboured under the same initial disadvantage as the cult of Osiris or
&AElig;sculapius&mdash;that, namely, of its founder never having lived
at all. What, then, did &ldquo;such students of religion, as the first
Christians were&rdquo; (<i lang="la">Ecce Deus</i>, p. 65), imagine was
to be gained by hood-winking their descendants for the long centuries
which have intervened between them and the advent of Professor W. B.
Smith? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=

same manner, as we know from Origen (<i>Com. in Evang. Ioannis</i>,
tom. xiii, 27), the Samaritans had a Messiah named Dositheos, who rose
from the dead, and professed himself to be the Messiah of prophecy. His
sect survived in the third century, as also his books, which, as Origen
says, were full of &ldquo;myth&rdquo; about him to the effect that he
had not tasted of death, but was somewhere or other still alive. By all
the rules of criticism as used by Mr. Robertson and his friends, we
must deny that Dositheos ever lived. The idea of a human hero being an
angel or divine power made flesh was common among Jews, and in their
apocryph, &ldquo;The Prayer of Jacob&rdquo; (see Origen, <i>op.
cit.</i>, tom. ii, 25), that worthy represented himself as such in the
very language of Paul and of the Fourth Gospel: &ldquo;I who spoke to
you, I, Jacob and Israel, am an angel of God and a primeval spirit, as
Abraham and Isaak were created in advance of all creatures. But I,
Jacob, &hellip; called Israel by God, a man seeing God, because I am
first-born of all living beings made alive by God.&rdquo; We also learn
that Uriel was sent forth by God to herald Jacob&rsquo;s descent upon
earth, where he &ldquo;tabernacled among men.&rdquo; Jacob declares
himself to be &ldquo;archangel of the power of God, and arch-captain
among the sons of God, Israel the foremost minister of the
Presence.&rdquo; Paul, we observe, did not need to go outside Judaism
for his conceptions of Jesus, nor Justin Martyr either, who regularly
speaks of Jesus as an archangel. So also among the pagans. In Augustus
C&aelig;sar his contemporaries loved to detect one of the great gods of
Olympus just descended to earth in the semblance of a man. He was the
god Mercury or some other god incarnate. His birth was a god&rsquo;s
descent to earth in order to expiate the sins of the Romans. Thus
Horace, <i>Odes</i>, I, 2, v. 29: <i lang="la">Cui dabit partes scelus
expiandi Juppiter</i>, and cp. v. 45: <i lang="la">Serus in c&oelig;lum

<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">Babylonian influence on Greek
religion slight;</span> The three writers whose views I have so far
considered agree in denying that Jesus was a real historical personage;
but their agreement extends no further, for the Jesus legend is the
precipitate, according to Professor W. B. Smith, of a monotheistic
propaganda; according to Mr. Robertson, of a movement mainly
idolatrous, polytheistic, and pagan. There exists in Germany, however,
a third school of denial, which sees in the Jesus story a duplicate of
the ancient Babylonian Gilgamesch legend. The more extreme writers of
this school have endeavoured to show that not only the Hebrews, but the
Greeks as well, derived their religious myths and rites from ancient
Babylon; and their general hypothesis has on that account been
nicknamed <i>Pan-Babylonismus</i>. This is not the place to criticize
the use made of old Babylonian mythology in explanation of old Greek
religion, though I do well to point out that the best students of the
latter&mdash;for example, Dr. Farnell&mdash;confine the indebtedness of
the Greeks to very narrow limits.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">on Hebrew religion more important;</span>
The case of the Hebrew scriptures and religion stands on different
ground; for the Jews were Semites, and their myths of creation and of
the origin and early history of man are, by the admission even of
orthodox divines of to-day, largely borrowed from the more ancient
civilization of Babylon. Thus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203"
href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>Heinrich Zimmern (art.
&ldquo;Deluge,&rdquo; in <i lang="la">Encyclop&aelig;dia Biblica</i>)
writes: &ldquo;Of all the parallel traditions of a deluge, the
Babylonian is undeniably the most important, because the points of
contact between it and the Hebrew story are so striking that the view
of the dependence of one of the two on the other is directly suggested
even to the most cautious of students.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">yet a Jew may have possessed some
imagination of his own</span> This undoubted occurrence of Babylonian
myths in the Book of Genesis has provided some less critical and
cautious cuneiform scholars with a clue, as they imagine, to the entire
contents of the Bible from beginning to end. It is as if the Jews, all
through their literary history of a thousand years, could not possibly
have invented any myths of their own, still less have picked a few up
elsewhere than in Babylon. Accordingly, in a volume of 1,030 enormous
pages, P. Jensen has undertaken to show<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4469src" href="#xd25e4469" name="xd25e4469src">1</a> that the New
Testament, no less than the Old, was derived from this single
well-spring. Moses and Aaron, Joshua, Jeroboam, Rehoboam, Hadad, Jacob
and Esau, Saul, David and Jonathan, Joseph and his brethren, Potiphar,
Rachel and Leah, Laban, Zipporah, Miriam sister of Moses, Dinah, Simeon
and Levi, Jethro and the Gibeonites and Sichemites, Sarah and Hagar,
<span class="marginnote">Gilgamesch, Eabani, and the holy harlot,
protagonists of the entire Old Testament</span>Abraham and Isaac,
Samson, Uriah and Nathan, Naboth, Elijah and Elisha, Naaman, Benhadad
and Hazael, Gideon, Jerubbaal, Abimelech, Jephthah, Tobit, Jehu, and
pretty well any other personage in the Old Testament, are duplicates,
according to him, of Gilgamesch or his companion the shepherd Eabani
(son of Ea), or of the Hierodule or sacred prostitute, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>and
of a few more leading figures in the Babylonian epic. There is hardly a
story in the whole of Jewish literature which is not, according to
Jensen, an echo of the Gilgamesch legend; and every personage, every
incident, is freely manipulated to make them fit this Procrustean bed.
No combinations of elements separated in the Biblical texts, no
separations of elements united therein, no recasting of the fabric of a
narrative, no modifications of any kind, are so violent as to deter Dr.
Jensen. At the top of every page is an abstract of its argument,
usually of this type: &ldquo;<i lang="de">Der Hirte Eabani, die
Hierodule und Gilgamesch. Der Hirte Moses, sein Weib und
Aaron.</i>&rdquo; In other words, as Moses was one shepherd and Eabani
another, Moses is no other than Eabani. As there is a sacred prostitute
in the Gilgamesch story, and a wife in the legend of Moses, therefore
wife and prostitute are one and the same. As Gilgamesch was companion
of Eabani, and Aaron of Moses, therefore Aaron was an <i>alias</i> of
Gilgamesch. Dr. Jensen is quite content with points of contact between
the stories so few and slight as the above, and pursues this sort of
loose argument over a thousand pages. Here is another such rubric:
&ldquo;<span lang="de">Simson-Gilgamesch&rsquo;s Leiche und
Saul-Gilgamesch&rsquo;s Gebeine wieder ausgegraben,
Elisa-Gilgamesch&rsquo;s Grab ge&ouml;ffnet.</span>&rdquo; In other
words, Simson, or Samson, left a corpse behind him (who does not?);
Saul&rsquo;s bones were piously looked after by the Jabeshites;
Elisha&rsquo;s bones raised a dead Moabite by mere contact to fresh
life. These three figures are, therefore, ultimately one, and that one
is Gilgamesch; and their three stories, which have no discernible
features in common, are so many disguises of the Gilgamesch epos.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">as also of the entire New
Testament</span>But Dr. Jensen transcends himself in the New
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>Testament. &ldquo;The Jesus-saga,&rdquo; he
informs us (p. 933), &ldquo;as it meets us in the Synoptic Gospels, and
equally as it meets us in John&rsquo;s Gospel, stands out among all the
other Gilgamesch Sagas which we have so far (<i>i.e.</i>, in the Old
Testament) expounded, in that it not merely follows up the main body of
the Saga with sundry fragments of it, like so many stragglers, but sets
before us a long series of bits of it arranged in the original order
almost undisturbed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4498src" href=
"#xd25e4498" name="xd25e4498src">2</a></p>
<p>And he waxes eloquent about the delusions and ignorance of
Christians, who for 2,000 years have been erecting churches and
cathedrals in honour of a Jesus of Nazareth, who all the time was a
mere <i>alias</i> of Gilgamesch.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">John&mdash;Eabani</span> Let us, then, test
some of the arguments by which this remarkable conclusion is reached.
Let us begin with John the Baptist (p. 811). John was a prophet, who
appeared east of the Jordan. So was Elias or Elijah. Elijah was a hairy
man, and John wore a raiment of camel&rsquo;s-hair; both of them wore
leather girdles.</p>
<p>Now, in the Gilgamesch story, Eabani is covered with hair all over
his body (p. 579&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="de">am ganzen Leibe mit
Haaren bedeckt ist</span>&rdquo;). Eabani (p. 818) is a hairy man, and
presumably was clad in skins (&ldquo;<span lang="de">ist ein haariger
Mann und vermutlich mit Fellen bekleidet</span>&rdquo;). Dr. Jensen
concludes from this that John and Elijah are both of them, equally and
independently, duplicates or understudies of Eabani. It <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>never occurs to him that in the desert
camel&rsquo;s-hair was a handy material out of which to make a coat, as
also leather to make girdles of, and that desert prophets in any story
whatever would inevitably be represented as clad in such a manner. He
has, indeed, heard of Jo. Weiss&rsquo;s suggestion that Luke had read
the LXX, and modelled his picture of John the Baptist on Elijah; but he
rejects the suggestion, for he feels&mdash;and rightly&mdash;that to
make any such admissions must compromise his main theory, which is that
the old Babylonian epic was the only source of the evangelists. No (he
writes), John&rsquo;s girdle, like Elijah&rsquo;s, came straight out of
the Saga (&ldquo;<span lang="de">wohl durch die Sage bedingt
ist</span>&rdquo;). Nor (he adds) can Luke&rsquo;s story of Sarah and
Zechariah be modelled on Old Testament examples, as critics have
argued. On the contrary, it is a fresh reflex of Gilgamesch
(&ldquo;<span lang="de">ein neuer Reflex</span>&rdquo;), an independent
sidelight cast by the central Babylonian orb (&ldquo;<span lang=
"de">ein neues Seitenst&uuml;ck</span>&rdquo;), and is copied direct.
We must not give in to the suggestion thrown out by modern critics that
it is a later addition to the original evangelical tradition. Far from
that being so, it must be regarded as an integral and original
constituent in the Jesus-saga (&ldquo;<span lang="de">So wird man
zugestehen m&uuml;ssen, dass sie keine Zugabe, sondern ein
integrierender Urbestandteil der Jesus-sage ist</span>&rdquo;).</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Jesus&mdash;Gilgamesch</span> From this and
many similar passages we realize that the view that Jesus never lived,
but was a mere reflex of Gilgamesch, is not, in Jensen&rsquo;s mind, a
conclusion to be proved, but a dogma assumed as the basis of all
argument, a dogma to which we must adjust all our methods of inquiry.
To admit any other sources of the Gospel story, let alone historical
facts, would be to infringe the exclusive apriority, as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>a
source, of the Babylonian epic; and that is why we are not allowed to
argue up to the latter, but only down from it. If for a moment he is
ready to admit that Old Testament narrative coloured Luke&rsquo;s
birth-story, and that (for example) the angel&rsquo;s visit in the
first chapter of Luke was suggested by the thirteenth chapter of
Judges, he speedily takes back the admission. Such an assumption is not
necessary (&ldquo;<span lang="de">allein n&ouml;tig ist ein solche
Annahme nicht</span>&rdquo;).</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much,&rdquo; he writes (p. 818),</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">of John&rsquo;s person alone. Let us now pursue the
Jesus Saga further.</p>
<p>In the Gilgamesch Epic it is related how the Hunter marched out to
Eabani with the holy prostitute, how Eabani enjoyed her, and afterwards
proceeded with her to Erech, where, directly or in his honour, a
festival was held; how he there attached himself to Gilgamesch, and how
kingly honours were by the latter awarded to him. We must by now in a
general way assume on the part of our readers a knowledge of how these
events meet us over again in the Sagas of the Old Testament. In the
numerous Gilgamesch Sagas, then [of the Old Testament], we found again
this rencounter with the holy prostitute. And yet we seek it in vain in
the three first Gospels in the exact context where we should find it on
the supposition that they must embody a Gilgamesch Saga&mdash;that is
to say, immediately subsequent to John&rsquo;s emergence in the desert.
Equally little do we find in this context any reflex of Eabani&rsquo;s
entry into the city of Erech, all agog at the moment with a festival.
On the other hand, we definitely find in its original position an echo
of Gilgamesch&rsquo;s meeting with Eabani.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4552src" href="#xd25e4552" name="xd25e4552src">3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Evangelists borrowed their saga from
Gilgamesch epos alone</span> Let us pause a moment and take stock of
the above. In the epic two heroes meet each other in a desert. John and
Jesus also meet in a desert; therefore, so argues Jensen, John and
Jesus are reproductions of the heroes in question, and neither of them
ever lived. It matters nothing that neither John nor Jesus was a
Nimrod. This encounter of Gilgamesch and Eabani was, as Jensen reminds
us, the model of every Old Testament story in which two males happen to
meet in a desert; therefore it must have been the model of the
evangelists also when they concocted their story of John and Jesus
meeting in the wilderness. But how about the prostitute; and how about
the entry into Erech? How are these lacun&aelig; of the Gospel story to
be filled in? Jensen&rsquo;s solution is remarkable; he finds the
encounter with the prostitute to have been the model on which the
fourth evangelist contrived his story of Jesus&rsquo;s visit to Martha
and Mary. For that evangelist, like the synoptical ones, had the
Gilgamesch Saga stored all ready in his escritoire, and finding that
his predecessors had omitted the prostitute he hastened to fill up the
lacuna, and doubled her into Martha and Mary. In this and many other
respects, so we are assured by Jensen, the fourth evangelist reproduces
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>Gilgamesch epic more fully and systematically
than the other evangelists, and on that account we must assign to
John&rsquo;s setting of the life of Christ a certain preference and
priority. He is truer to the only source there was for any of it. The
other lacuna of the Synoptic Gospels is the feasting in Erech and
Eabani&rsquo;s entry amid general feasting into that city. The
corresponding episode in the Gospels, we are assured, is the triumphant
entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, which the Fourth Gospel, again hitting
the right nail on the head, sets at the beginning of Jesus&rsquo;s
ministry, and not at its end. But what, we still ask, is the Gospel
counterpart to the honours heaped by Gilgamesch on Eabani? How dull we
are! &ldquo;The baptism of Jesus by John must, apart from other
considerations, have arisen out of the fact that Eabani, after his
arrival at Gilgamesch&rsquo;s palace, is by him allotted kingly
honours.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4587src" href="#xd25e4587"
name="xd25e4587src">4</a></p>
<p>So then Eabani, who as a hairy man was John the Baptist, is now, by
a turn of Jensen&rsquo;s kaleidoscope, metamorphosed into Jesus, for it
is John who did Jesus the honour of baptizing him. Conversely,
Gilgamesch, who began as Jesus, is now suddenly turned into John. In
fact, Jesus-Gilgamesch and John-Eabani have suddenly changed places
with one another, in accordance, I suppose, with the rule of
interpretation, somewhere laid down by Hugo Winckler, that in astral
myths one hero is apt to swop with another, not only his stage
properties, but his personality. But fresh surprises are in store for
Jensen&rsquo;s readers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href=
"#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span></p>
<p>Over scores of pages he has argued that John the Baptist is no other
than Eabani, because he so faithfully fulfils over again the
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> of the Eabanis we meet with in the Old Testament. For
example, according to Luke (i, 15, and vii, 33) John drinks no wine,
and is, therefore, a Nazirean, who eschews wine and forbears to cut his
hair. Therein he resembles Joseph-Eabani, and Simson-Eabani, and
Samuel-Eabani, and also Absolom, who, as an Eabani, had at least an
upper growth of hair. And as the Eabani of the Epic, with the long
head-hair of a woman, drinks water along with the wild beasts in the
desert, and as Eabani, in company with these beasts, feeds on grass and
herbs alone, so, at any rate according to Luke, John ate no
bread.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4601src" href="#xd25e4601" name=
"xd25e4601src">5</a></p>
<p>Imagine the reader&rsquo;s consternation when, after these
convincing demonstrations of John&rsquo;s identity with Eabani, and of
his consequent non-historicity, he finds him a hundred pages later on
altogether eliminated, as from the Gilgamesch Epic, so from the Gospel.
For the difficulty suddenly arises before Dr. Jensen&rsquo;s mind that
John the Baptist, being mentioned by Josephus, must after all have
really lived; but if he lived, then he cannot have been a mere reflex
of Eabani. Had he only consulted Dr. Drews&rsquo;s work on the
<i>Witnesses to the Historicity of Jesus</i> (English translation, p.
190), he would have known that &ldquo;the John <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>of
the Gospels&rdquo; is no other than &ldquo;the Babylonian Oannes,
Joannes, or Hanni, the curiously-shaped creature, half fish and half
man, who, according to Berosus, was the first law-giver and inventor of
letters and founder of civilization, and who rose every morning from
the waves of the Red Sea in order to instruct men as to his real
spiritual nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why could not Dr. Jensen consult Dr. Drews &ldquo;as to the real
spiritual nature&rdquo; of John the Baptist? Why not consult Mr.
Robertson, who overwhelms Josephus&rsquo;s inconvenient testimony to
the reality of John the Baptist (in 18 <i>Antiq.</i>, v, &sect; 2) with
the customary &ldquo;suspicion of interpolation.&rdquo; Poor Dr. Jensen
lacks their resourcefulness, and is able to discover no other way out
of his <i>impasse</i> than to suppose that it was originally Lazarus
and not John that had a place in his Gilgamesch Epic, and that some
ill-natured editor of the Gospels, for reasons he alone can divine,
everywhere struck out the name of Lazarus, and inserted in place of it
that of John the Baptist, which he found in the works of Josephus. Such
are the possibilities of Gospel redaction as Jensen understands
them.</p>
<p>One more example of Dr. Jensen&rsquo;s system. In the Gospel, Jesus,
finding himself on one occasion surrounded by a larger throng of people
than was desirable, took a boat in order to get away from them, and
passed across the lake on the shore of which he had been preaching and
ministering to the sick. The incident is a commonplace one enough, but
nothing is too slight and unimportant for Dr. Jensen to detect in it a
Gilgamesch parallel, and accordingly he writes thus of it: &ldquo;As
for Xisuthros, so for Jesus, a boat is lying ready, and like Xisuthros
and Jonas, Jesus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212"
name="pb212">212</a>]</span>&lsquo;flees&rsquo; in a
boat.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4674src" href="#xd25e4674"
name="xd25e4674src">6</a> Xisuthros, I may remind the reader, is the
name of the flood-hero in Berosus. Hardly a single one of the parallels
which crowd the thousand pages of Dr. Jensen is less flimsy than the
above. Without doing more violence to texts and to probabilities, one
could prove that Achilles and Patroclus and Helen, &AElig;neas and
Achates and Dido, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza and Dulcinea, were all
of them so many understudies of Gilgamesch, Eabani and his temple
slave; and we almost expect to find such a demonstration in his
promised second volume.</p>
<p>I cannot but think that my readers will resent any further specimens
of Dr. Jensen&rsquo;s system. He has not troubled himself to acquire
the merest <i>a b c</i> of modern textual criticism. He has no sense of
the differences of idea and style which divide the Fourth from the
earlier Gospels, and he lacks all insight into the development of the
Gospel tradition. He takes Christian documents out of their historical
context, and ignores their dependence on the Judaism of the period
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> 100 to <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 100.
He has no understanding of the prophetic, Messianic and Apocalyptic
aspects of early Christianity, no sense of its intimate relations with
the beliefs and opinions which lie before us in apocryphs like the Book
of Enoch, the Fourth Esdras, the Ascent of Isaiah, the Testaments of
the Patriarchs. He has never learned that in the four Gospels he has
before him successive stages or layers of stratification of Christian
tradition, and he accordingly treats them as a single literary block,
of which every part is of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href=
"#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>the same age and evidential value.
Like his Gilgamesch Epic the Gospels, for all he knows about them,
might have been dug up only yesterday among the sands of Mesopotamia,
instead of being the work of a sect with which, as early as the end of
the first century, we are fairly well acquainted. Never once does he
ask himself how the authors of the New Testament came to have the
Gilgamesch Epic at the tips of their tongues, exactly in the form in
which he translates it from Babylonian tablets incised 2,000 years
before Christ? By what channels did it reach them? Why were they at
such pains to transform it into the story of a Galilean Messiah
crucified by the Roman Governor of Jud&aelig;a? And as Paul and Peter,
like everyone else named in the book, are duplicates of Gilgamesch and
Eabani, where are we to draw the line of intersection between heaven
and earth; where fix the year in which the early Christians ceased to
be myths and became mere men and women? This is a point it equally
behoves Dr. Drews and Mr. Robertson and Professor W. B. Smith to clear
up our doubts about. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of the books passed in review in the preceding pages,
as of several others couched in the same vein and recently published in
England and Germany, perhaps the best that can be said is this, that,
at any rate, they are untrammelled by orthodox prejudice, and
fearlessly written. That they belong, so to speak, to the extreme left,
explains the favour with which they are received by that section of the
middle-class reading public which has conceived a desire to learn
something of the origins of Christianity. Unschooled in the criticism
of documents, such readers have learned in the school Bible-lesson and
in the long hours of instruction in what is called Divinity, to regard
the Bible as they regard no other collection of ancient writings. It
is, as a rule, the only ancient book they ever opened. They have
discovered that orthodoxy depends for its life on treating it as a book
apart, not to be submitted to ordinary tests, not to be sifted and
examined, as we have learned from Hume and Niebuhr, Gibbon and Grote,
to sift ancient documents in general, rejecting <i lang="la">ab
initio</i> the supernatural myths that are never absent from them. The
acuter minds among the clergy themselves begin nowadays to realize that
the battle of Freethought and Rationalism is won as far as the miracles
of the Old Testament are concerned; but as regards those of the New
they are for ever trying to close up their ranks and rally <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>their hosts afresh. Nevertheless, the man in the
street has a shrewd suspicion that apologetics are so much special
pleading, and that miracles cannot be eliminated from the Old and yet
remain in the New Testament. He has never received any training in
methods of historical research himself, and it is no easy thing to
obtain; but he is clever enough to detect the evasions of apologists,
and, with instinctive revulsion, turns away to writers who &ldquo;go
the whole hog&rdquo; and argue for the most extreme positions, even to
the length of asserting that the story of Jesus is a myth from
beginning to end. Any narratives, he thinks, that have the germs of
truth in them would not need the apologetic prefaces and commentaries,
the humming and hawing, the specious arguments and wire-drawn
distinctions of divines, any more than do Froissart or Clarendon or
Herodotus. If the New Testament needs them, then it must be a mass of
fable from end to end. Such is the impression which our modern
apologists leave on the mind of the ordinary man.</p>
<p>I can imagine some of my readers objecting here that, whereas I have
so rudely assailed the method of interpretation of New Testament
documents adopted by the Nihilistic school&mdash;I only use this name
as a convenient label for those who deny the historical reality of
Jesus Christ&mdash;I nevertheless propound no rival method of my own.
The truth is there is no abstract method of using documents relating to
the past, and you cannot in advance lay down rules for doing so. You
can only learn how to deal with them by practice, and it is one of the
chief functions of any university or place of higher education to imbue
students with historical method by setting before <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>them
the original documents, and inspiring them to extract from them
whatever solid results they can. A hundred years ago the better men in
the college of Christchurch at Oxford were so trained by the dean,
Cyril Jackson, who would set them the task of &ldquo;preparing for
examination the whole of Livy and Polybius, thoroughly read and studied
in all their comparative bearings.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4706src" href="#xd25e4706" name="xd25e4706src">1</a> No better
curriculum, indeed, could be devised for strengthening and developing
the faculty of historical judgment; and the schools of <i>Literae
Humaniores</i> and <i>Modern History</i>, which were subsequently
established at Oxford, carried on the tradition of this enlightened
educationalist. In them the student is brought face to face in the
original dialects with the records of the past, and stimulated to
&ldquo;read and study them in their comparative bearings.&rdquo; One
single branch of learning, however, has been treated apart in the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and pursued along the lines of
tradition and authority&mdash;I mean the study of Christian
antiquities. The result has been deplorable. Intellectually-minded
Englishmen have turned away from this field of history as from
something tainted, and barely one of our great historians in a century
deems it worthy of his notice. It has been left to parsons, to men who
have never learned to swim, because they have never had enough courage
to venture into deep water. As we sow, so we reap. The English Church
is probably the most enlightened of the many sects that make up
Christendom. Yet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217"
name="pb217">217</a>]</span>what is the treatment which it accords to
any member of itself who has the courage to dissociate himself from the
&ldquo;orthodoxy&rdquo; of the fourth century, of those Greek Fathers
(so-called) in whom the human intelligence sank to the nadir of
fanaticism and futility? An example was recently seen in the case of
the Rev. Mr. W. H. Thompson, a young theological tutor of Magdalen
College in Oxford, who, animated by nothing but loyalty for the Church,
recently liberated his soul about the miracles of the Gospels in a
thoroughly scholarly book entitled <i>Miracles in the New
Testament</i>. The attitude of the clergy in general towards a work of
genuine research, which sets truth above traditional orthodoxy, was
revealed in a conference of the clergy of the southern province, held
soon after its publication on May 19, 1911. The following account of
that meeting is taken from the <i>Guardian</i> of May 26,
1911:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The Rev. R. F. Bevan, in the Canterbury Diocesan
Conference on May 19, 1911, proposed &ldquo;that this Conference is of
opinion that the clergy should make use of the light thrown on the
Bible by modern criticism for the purposes of religious
teaching.&rdquo; The Bishop of Croydon moved the following rider:
&ldquo;But desires to record its distrust of critics who, while holding
office in the Church of Christ, propound views inconsistent with the
doctrines laid down in the creeds of the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said it was needful to define what was meant by modern criticism.
He referred to a book which had been published quite lately by the Dean
of Divinity of Magdalen College, Oxford, a review of which would be
found in the <i>Guardian</i> of May 12. He must honestly confess he had
not read the book for himself&#8202;&hellip;. He then premised from the
review that the work in question rejects the evidence both for the
Virgin Birth of Christ and for his bodily <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>Resurrection from the
tomb &hellip;, and added that the toleration by Churchmen of such
doctrines and such views being taught within the bosom of the Church
was to him most sad and inexplicable. If such was the instruction which
young Divinity students were receiving at the universities, no wonder
that the supply of candidates for ordination was falling off.</p>
<p>The Rev. J. O. Bevan said it was not in the power of any man or any
body of men to ignore the Higher Criticism or to suppress it. It had
&ldquo;come to stay,&rdquo; and its influence for good or evil must be
recognized.</p>
<p>The President (Archbishop of Canterbury) said that &ldquo;Bible
teaching ought to be given with a background of knowledge on the part
of the teacher. He should deprecate as strongly as anybody that men who
felt that they could not honestly continue to hold the Christian creeds
should hold office in the Church of England. But he saw no connection
between the sort of teaching which the Conference had now been
considering and the giving up of the Christian creed. The Old Testament
was a literature which had come down to them from ancient days. Modern
investigation enabled them now to set the earlier stages of that
literature in somewhat different surroundings from those in which they
were set by their fathers and grandfathers.&rdquo; With regard to the
book which had been referred to, the Archbishop said that, if the rider
proposed was intended to imply a censure upon a particular writer,
nothing would induce him to vote for it, inasmuch as he had not read
the book, and knew nothing, at first hand, about it. He thought members
ought to pause before they lightly gave votes which could be so
interpreted.</p>
<p>The motion, on being put to the meeting, was carried with one
dissentient. The rider was also carried by a majority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It amounts, then, to this, that a rule of limited liability is to be
observed in the investigation of early Christianity. You may be
critical, but not up to the point of calling in question the Virgin
Birth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>or physical resurrection of Christ. The Bishop
of Croydon opines that the free discussion of such questions in
University circles intimidates young men from taking orders. If he
lived in Oxford, he would know that it is the other way about.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e4745src" href="#xd25e4745" name="xd25e4745src">2</a>
If Mr. Thompson had been allowed to say what he thought, unmolested; if
the Bishops of Winchester and of Oxford had not at once taken steps to
silence and drive him out of the Church, students would have been
better encouraged to enter the Anglican ministry, and the more
intellectual of our young men would not avoid it as a profession hard
to reconcile with truth and honesty and self-respect.</p>
<p>In the next number of the same journal (June 2, 1911) is recorded
another example of how little our bishops are inclined to face a plain
issue. It is contained in a paragraph headed thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">SYMBOLISM OF THE ASCENSION.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The Bishop of Birmingham on the Second
Coming.</span></p>
<p>Preaching to a large congregation in Birmingham Cathedral &hellip;
the Bishop of Birmingham said that people had found difficulty in
modern times about the Ascension, because, they said,
&ldquo;God&rsquo;s heaven is no more above our heads than under our
feet.&rdquo; That was perfectly true. But there were certain ways of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>expressing moral ideas rooted in human thought,
and we did not the less speak continually of the above and the below as
expressing what was morally high and morally low, and we should go on
doing so to the end. The ascension of Jesus Christ and his concealment
in the clouds was a symbolical act, like all the acts after his
Resurrection; it was to impress their minds with the truth of his
mounting to the glory of God. Symbols were the best means of expressing
the truth about things which lay outside their experience; and the
Ascension symbolized Christ&rsquo;s mounting to the supreme state of
power and glory, to the perfect vision of God, to the throne of all the
world&#8202;&hellip;. The Kingdom was coming&mdash;had to come at
last&mdash;&ldquo;on earth as it is in heaven&rdquo;; and one day, just
as his disciples saw him passing away out of their experience and
sight, would they see him coming back into their experience and their
sight, and into his perfected Kingdom of Humanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I am sure that what people in modern times chiefly want to know
about the Ascension is whether it really happened. Did Jesus in his
physical body go up like a balloon before the eyes of the faithful, and
disappear behind a cloud, or did he not? That is the plain issue, and
Dr. Gore seems to avoid it. If he believes in such a miracle, why
expatiate on the symbolism of all the acts of Jesus subsequent to his
resurrection? Such a miracle was surely sufficient unto itself, and
never needed our attention to be drawn to its symbolical aspects and
import. Does he mean that the legend is no more than &ldquo;a certain
way of expressing moral ideas rooted in human thought&rdquo;? May we
welcome his insistence on its moral symbolism as a prelude to his
abandonment of the literal truth of the tale? I hope so, for in not a
few apologetic books published by divines during the last twenty-five
years I have encountered a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href=
"#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>tendency to expatiate on the moral
significance of extinct Biblical legends. It is, as the Rev. Mr. Figgis
expresses it, a way of &ldquo;letting down the laity into the new
positions of the Higher Criticism.&rdquo; Would it not be simpler, in
the end, to tell people frankly that a legend is only a legend? They
are not children in arms. Why is it accounted so terrible for a
clergyman or minister of religion to express openly in the pulpit
opinions he can hear in many academical lecture-rooms, and often
entertains in the privacy of his study? When the Archbishop of
Canterbury tells his brother-doctors that &ldquo;modern investigation
enables them now to set the earlier stages of Old Testament literature
in somewhat different surroundings from those in which they were set by
their fathers and grandfathers,&rdquo; he means that modern scholarship
has emptied the Old Testament of its miraculous and supernatural
legends. But the Anglican clergyman at ordination declares that he
believes unfeignedly the whole of the Old and New Testaments. How can
an Archbishop not dispense his clergy from belief in the New, when he
is so ready to leave it to their individual consciences whether they
will or will not believe in the Old? The entire position is hollow and
illogical, and most of the bishops know it; but, instead of frankly
recognizing facts, they descant upon the symbolical meaning of tales
which they know they must openly abandon to-morrow. One is inclined to
ask Dr. Gore why Christ could not have imparted in words to his
followers the secret of his mounting to the supreme state of power and
glory? Did they at the time, or afterwards, set any such interpretation
on the story of his rising up from the ground like an airship or an
exhalation? Of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>course they did not. They thought the earth was
a fixed, flat surface, and that, if you ascended through the several
lower heavens, you would find yourself before a great white throne, on
which sat, in Oriental state, among his winged cherubim, the Most High.
They thought that Jesus consummated the hackneyed miracle of his
ascension by sitting down on the right hand of this Heavenly Potentate.
If Dr. Gore doubts this, let him consult the voluminous works of the
early Fathers on the subject. The entire legend coheres with ancient,
and not with modern, cosmogony. How can it possibly be defended to-day
on grounds of symbolism, or on any other? The same criticism applies to
the legend of the Virgin Birth. The Bishop of London is reduced to
defending this thrum of ancient paganism by an appeal to the biological
fact of parthenogenesis among insects. Imagine the mentality of a
modern bishop who dreams that he is advancing the cause of true
religion and sound learning by assimilating the birth of his Saviour to
that of a rotifer or a flea!</p>
<p>The books of Dr. Drews and Mr. Robertson and others of their school
are, no doubt, blundering extravaganzas, all the more inopportune
because they provoke the gibes of Dr. Moulton; but they are at least
works of Freethought. Their authors do not write with one eye on the
truth and the other on the Pope in the Vatican, or on the obsolete
dogmas of Byzantine speculation. It is possible, therefore, to discuss
with them, as it is not with apologists, who take good care never to
lay all their cards on the table, and of whom you cannot but feel, as
the great historian Mommsen remarked, that they are chattering in
chains (<i lang="la">ex vinculis sermocinantes</i>). In the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>investigation of truth there can be no mental
reserves, and argument is useless where the final appeal lies to a Pope
or a creed. You cannot set your hand to the plough and then look
back.</p>
<p>It was not, then, within the scope of this essay to try to determine
how much and what particular incidents traditionally narrated of Jesus
are credible. Such a task would require at least a thousand pages for
its discharge; I have merely desired to show how difficult it is to
prove a negative, and how much simpler it is to admit that Jesus really
lived than to argue that he was a solar or other myth. The latter
hypothesis, as expounded in these works, offends every principle of
philology, of comparative mythology, and of textual criticism; it
bristles with difficulties; and, if no better demonstration of it can
be offered, it deserves to be summarily dismissed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, no absolute rules can be laid down a priori for
the discerning in early Christian or in any other ancient documents of
historical fact. But students embarking on a study of Christian origins
will do well to lay to heart the aphorism of Renan (<i lang="fr">Les
Ap&ocirc;tres, Introd.</i> xxix), that &ldquo;one can only ascertain
the origin of any particular religion from the narratives or reports of
those who believed therein; for it is only the sceptic who writes
history <i lang="la">ad narrandum</i>.&rdquo; It is in the very nature
of things human that we could not hope to obtain documents more
evidential than the Gospels and <i>Acts</i>. It is a lucky chance that
time has spared to us the Epistles of Paul as well, and the sparse
notices of first-century congregations and personalities preserved in
Josephus and in pagan writers. For during the first two or three
generations of its existence the Church interested few <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>except itself. In the view of a Josephus, the
Jewish converts could only figure as Jews gone astray after a false
Messiah, just as the Gentile recruits were mere Judaizers,
objects&mdash;as he remarks, <i>B. J.</i>, II, 18, 2&mdash;of equal
suspicion to Syrian pagans and Jews alike, an ambiguous, neutral class,
spared by the knife of the pagans, yet dreaded by the Jews as at heart
aliens to their cause.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4794src" href=
"#xd25e4794" name="xd25e4794src">3</a> There were no folklorists or
comparative religionists in those days watching for new cults to
appear; and there could be little or no inclination to sit down and
write history among enthusiasts who dreamed that the end of the world
was close at hand, and believed themselves to be already living in the
last days. For this is the conviction that colours the whole of the New
Testament; and that it does so is a signal proof of the antiquity of
much that the book contains. If a Christian of the first century ever
took up his pen and wrote, it was not to hand down an objective
narrative of events to a posterity whose existence he barely
contemplated, but, as against unbelieving Jews, to establish from
ancient prophecy his belief in Jesus as the promised Messiah, or
perhaps as the Word of God made flesh. All Christians were aware that
Jews, both in Jud&aelig;a and of the Dispersion, roundly denied their
Christ to have been anything better than an impostor and violator of
the Law. They heard the pagans round them echoing the scoffs of their
Messiah&rsquo;s own countrymen. Accordingly, the earliest literature of
the Church, so far as it is not merely homiletic and hortative, is
controversial, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>and aims at proving that the Jewish people were
mistaken in rejecting Jesus as the Messiah. The Jews neither then nor
now have fought with mere shadows; and just in proportion as they bore
witness against his Messiahship, they bore witness in favour of his
historical reality. It is a pity that the extreme negative school
ignore this aspect of his rejection by the Jews.</p>
<p>Let me cite one more wise rule laid down by Renan in the same
<i>Introduction</i>: &ldquo;An ancient writing can help us to throw
light, firstly, on the age in which it was composed, and, secondly, on
the age which preceded its composition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This indicates in a general fashion the use which historians should
make of the New Testament. We have at every turn to ask ourselves what
the circumstances its contents reveal presuppose in the immediate past
in the way both of ideas or aspirations and of fact or incidents.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I cannot do better than quote the words in which
Renan defines in general terms the sort of historical results we may
hope to attain in the field of Christian origins. It is from the
<i>Introduction</i> already cited, pp. vi and vii:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">In histories like this, where the general outline
(<i>ensemble</i>) alone is certain, and where nearly all the details
lend themselves more or less to doubt by reason of the legendary
character of the documents, hypothesis is indispensable. About ages of
which we know nothing we cannot frame any hypothesis at all. To try to
reconstitute a particular group of ancient statuary, which certainly
once existed, but of which we have not even the debris, and about which
we possess no written information, is to attempt an entirely arbitrary
task. But to endeavour to recompose the friezes of the Parthenon from
what remains <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>to us, using as subsidiary to our work ancient
texts, drawings made in the seventeenth century, and availing ourselves
of all sources of information; in a word, inspiring ourselves by the
style of these inimitable fragments, and endeavouring to seize their
soul and life&mdash;what more legitimate task than this? We cannot,
indeed, after all, say that we have rediscovered the work of the
ancient sculptor; nevertheless, we shall have done all that was
possible in order to approximate thereto. Such a method is all the more
legitimate in history, because language permits the use of dubitative
moods of which marble admits not. There is nothing to prevent our
setting before the reader a choice of different suppositions, and the
author&rsquo;s conscience may be at rest as soon as he has set forth as
certain what is certain, as probable what is probable, as possible what
is possible. In those parts of the field where our footstep slides and
slips between history and legend it is only the general effect that we
must seek after&#8202;&hellip;. Accomplished facts speak more plainly
than any amount of biographic detail. We know very little of the
peerless artists who created the <i>chefs d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> of
Greek art. Yet these <i>chefs d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> tell us more of
the personality of their authors and of the public which appreciated
them than ever could do the most circumstantial narratives and the most
authentic of texts.</p>

the last two months the theological faculties of Oxford and Cambridge,
and the examining chaplains (of various bishops) resident in those
universities, have addressed a petition to the Archbishop of Canterbury
praying him to absolve candidates for Ordination of the necessity of
avowing that &ldquo;they believe unfeignedly in the whole of the Old
and New Testaments,&rdquo; because so many competent and well-qualified
students are thereby deterred from taking holy orders. The Archbishop
would, it seems, make the individual clergyman&rsquo;s conscience the
sole judge (to the exclusion of the Bishop of Croydon) of the propriety
of his retaining his orders in spite of his rejection of this and that
tradition or dogma. That is at least a sign that opinion is on the
